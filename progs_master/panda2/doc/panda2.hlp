.    PANDAOPT
.
.      This command initiates a batch run of the PANDA2 mainprocessor.
.      The results are stored in a file NAME.OPM, in which NAME is the
.      same name you chose for BEGIN, SETUP, BOSMODEL, MAINSETUP, etc.
.      To do several sets of design iterations you issue the command
.      PANDAOPT again and again. Make sure to print out the file
.      NAME.OPM after each batch run corresponding to each PANDAOPT.
.      Only the latest NAME.OPM is retained.
.
.      The batch run following PANDAOPT now also executes a processor
.      called STORE (See HELPAN PROGRAMS STORE, HELPAN LIBRARIES STORE,
.      and HELPAN FILES GENERAL). This STORE processor does one of two
.      things, depending on the analysis type control integer, ITYPE:
.
.      ITYPE = 1 (Optimization): STORE (calling STORE1) accumulates
.      results from all design iterations from the beginning of the
.      case for future plotting via the commands CHOOSEPLOT and DIPLOT.
.      The STORE processor produces a file called *.OPP, which the user
.      should list before proceeding with CHOOSEPLOT and DIPLOT.
.
.      ITYPE = 3 (Test simulation of optimized panel.): STORE (calling 
.      SUBROUTINE STORE2) accumulates behaviors, margins, deformed
.      shapes, etc. for a panel of fixed design, one load set, for a
.      series of monotonically increasing loads Nx, Ny, Nxy, p. The
.      STORE processor produces a file called *.OPI, which the user
.      should list before proceeding with CHOOSEPLOT and DIPLOT.

.    CHOOSEPLOT                 (26 JAN 1989-21 March 1989 ENHANCEMENT)
.
.      You choose which parameters are to be plotted. CHOOSEPLOT
.      input/output depend on the analysis type control, ITYPE.
. 
.      ITYPE = 1 (Optimization) There are three categories of parameters:
.
.           1. design parameters (which include the decision variables)
.           2. design margins
.           3. the objective.
.
.         All variables are plotted versus design iterations since
.         the beginning of the case, even though you may have given
.         the command PANDAOPT many times: The results from iterations
.         for each PANDAOPT are added to results accumulated from
.         previous PANDAOPTs.
.
.         Design margins can be plotted for each load set and each
.         of possibly two subcases within that load set.  Data for
.         Data for each subcase of each load set are stored in
.         separate files.  Subcase 1 corresponds to conditions at the
.         midlength of the panel;  subcase 2 corresponds to conditions
.         at the ends of the panel.  Most of the time there is only
.         one subcase, Subcase 1.  However, if the panel is clamped
.         at the axially loaded ends in the prebuckling phase, and if
.         there is applied normal pressure, there are two subcases for
.         each load set that includes nonzero normal pressure.
.
.         The following discussion applies for each subcase of each
.         load set.
.
.         You are allowed to choose up to 10 variables in each of the
.         two categories (1 = design variables; 2 = design margins.)
.         Please note, however, that all variables
.         chosen within a single category are plotted on the same
.         frame.  Therefore, it might be well to keep the maximum
.         number you choose at one time down to 5 or so.  You can
.         always run CHOOSEPLOT again in order to pick up other
.         variables. Also, it is a good idea to "bundle" those variables
.         together that have similar magnitudes. For example, thicknesses
.         of things are likely to be much smaller than lengths or widths.
.         It is a good idea, therefore, to plot thicknesses in separate
.         runs from those in which you plot lengths and widths.
.
.         An image of the interactive session in CHOOSEPLOT is stored on
.         a small file with the name NAME.CPL, which can be used as input
.         to CHOOSEPLOT in case you goof, as discussed with BEGIN and DECIDE.
.
.         CHOOSEPLOT generates three files which are used as input to
.         DIPLOT, as follows:
.
.            1. NAME.PL3 = design margins chosen in CHOOSEPLOT
.            2. NAME.PL4 = design variables chosen in CHOOSEPLOT
.            3. NAME.PL5 = the objective.
.
.         NAME is the specific case name.  The three files, NAME.PLn, n=3,4,5,
.         are used as input for the DIPLOT processor.
.
.         CHOOSEPLOT also generates a file NAME.OPL, which you should inspect
.         before you use DIPLOT.  NAME.OPL contains lists of definitions of
.         all margins and variables that can be plotted v. iterations, and
.         contains lists of the values v. iteration no. for those margins
.         and design variables actually chosen for plotting.
.
.
.      ITYPE = 3 (Simulation of test on a panel of fixed design) There are
.                 five categories of parameters:
.
.           1. various behaviors, such as maximum post-local-buckling
.              displacement, postbuckling tangent stiffness, load re-
.              distribution over the skin-stringer module after local
.              buckling, increased bowing of the panel under increasing
.              load, slope of the buckling nodal lines, etc.
.           2. design margins as functions of the load on a panel of
.              fixed design.
.           3. deformation of the skin-stringer panel module as a function
.              of load.
.           4. locations (plots) of layer types. (A layer type is
.              characterized by (a) thickness, (b) winding angle, (c) mat'l.)
.           5. "3-D" plots of the locally postbuckled skin-stringer panel
.              module at the load corresponding to the last load step
.              processed by PANDAOPT.
.
.      ITYPE = 4 (Design sensitivity)
.
.           This branch gets plots of margins vs. a user-selected
.           decision variable. Figs. 25-28 in "IMPROVEMENTS TO PANDA2"
.           Vol. 1, revised November, 1991 provide examples.
.
.      ITYPE = 5 (Load interaction curves)
.
.           This branch gets load-interaction curves, such as shown
.           in Figs. 31 and 34 of "IMPROVEMENTS TO PANDA2", Vol. 1,
.           revised November, 1991.
.
.         An image of the interactive session in CHOOSEPLOT is stored on
.         a small file with the name NAME.CPL, which can be used as input
.         to CHOOSEPLOT in case you goof, as discussed with BEGIN and DECIDE.
.
.         CHOOSEPLOT generates five files which are used as input to
.         DIPLOT, as follows:
.
.            1. NAME.PL3 = design margins chosen in CHOOSEPLOT v. load steps;
.            2. NAME.PL4 = behaviors chosen in CHOOSEPLOT v. load steps;
.            3. NAME.PL5 = deformed skin-stringer module for load steps
.                          chosen in CHOOSEPLOT;
.            4. NAME.PL6 = locations of layer types in skin-stringer module;
.            5. NAME.PL7 = "3-D" plot input data for final load step.
.
.         As with the ITYPE=1 branch, the files NAME.PLn, n= 3,4,5,6,7 are
.         input data for DIPLOT.
.
.         As with the ITYPE=1 branch, CHOOSEPLOT also generates a file

.
.      You obtain the plots chosen by CHOOSEPLOT. (Give the help

.
.      All variables are plotted versus design iterations since

.      that you wanted to reset ITRTOT to zero, even though you may
.      have given the command PANDAOPT many times since then: 
.      The results from iterations for each PANDAOPT are automatically

.
.   With ITYPE = 1:
.      NAME.PL3, .PL4, and .PL5 have analogous structure, as follows:
.       1. The first record is the number of traces n in the plot frame

.       2. The second record is the word ITERATIONS.
.       3. The third through n+2 records are the legend definitions
.          of the first through nth traces in the plot frame.
.       7. The remaining records represent the abscissa value and the
.          n ordinate values for the n traces in the plot frame. The
.          first column of this array of data contains the abscissa
.          values, which are iteration numbers in floating point format.
.          The second column contains the ordinate values for the first

.    GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT DEBUGGING INPUT DATA
.
.      The PANDA2 capability involves two computer program systems:
.
.           1. programs that are associated with the special
.              configuration called a "panel module" (see OVERVIEW);
.
.           2. BOSOR4 processors
.
.      For information on debugging BOSOR4 input data, give the
.      command   BOSOR4LOG   followed by   HELP4 DEBUG.
.
.      For information on debugging PANDA2 input data, give the
.      command  HELPAN DEBUG PANDA2
.
.      If you are fairly certain that there is a bug in one or more
.      of the BOSOR or PANDA processors, write or call the developer:

.    DEBUGGING PANDA2 INPUT DATA AND TROUBLE SHOOTING RUNS
.
.  The following kinds of difficulties might occur following execution
.  of PANDAOPT (the mainprocessor of PANDA2):
.
.    1. The local instability mode shape may not correspond to
.       buckling of the panel skin. This might be the case, for
.       example, if the starting design has ridiculously thin or
.       deep stiffener webs, or if you use a very high number of
.       axial waves as a starting value in the search for a minimum
.       critical load. Then the local buckling load calculated in
.       PANDAOPT might correspond to stiffener web crippling rather
.       than local skin buckling, and application of the Koiter
.       postbuckling theory might lead to a peculiar design. 
.
.    2. The mode shape and eigenvalue named "wide column buckling" may
.       not in fact be general buckling, but simply local buckling of
.       the skin only with a very long axial half wave (one axial
.       half wave over the entire length of the panel). You can check
.       if this has happened by obtaining plots as above.  Also, a
.       message will be printed out in the NAME.OPM file if it appears
.       that "wide column" buckling is actually local instability with
.       one half wave in the axial direction. Should this be the case,
.       the PANDA2 system will automatically use the general instability
.       estimate from the PANDA-type of analysis for the general
.       instability constraint.
.
.  Both of these difficulties can easily be avoided by changing the
.  starting design and/or number of axial waves in the local buckling
.  pattern.

.   GENERAL INFORMATION ON FILES....
.
.      Runs of PANDA2 generate many files. Most of these files have
.      a name such as NAME.BEG  or  NAME.DEC,  etc., in which
.      NAME is a name that you assign the case.  The most important
.      of these files from the user's viewpoint are:
.
.      Input data:    NAME.BEG   NAME.DEC   NAME.OPT   NAME.CPL  NAME.CPT
.      Output data:   NAME.OPM   NAME.OPP   NAME.OPI   NAME.OPL  NAME.OPTEMP
.
.
.   NOTE:  26 JAN - 17 MAY 1989  IMPROVEMENTS TO PANDA2 FOLLOW....
.          (An example of use of the improvements is included in
.           the file called SAMPLE.CAS)
.
.  1. PLOTTING DESIGN VARIABLES, DESIGN MARGINS, AND OBJECTIVE v.
.     DESIGN ITERATIONS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE:
.
.      Early in 1989 PANDA2 was enhanced by three processors, STORE,
.      CHPLOT, and DIPLOT, which allow results from all design
.      iterations since the beginning of the case to be accumulated
.      in files and plotted v. design iterations.  These processors
.      generate several files, examples of which are listed as follows
.      for a particular case called ARIANE:
.
.       ARIANE.CPL;5              2/3       21-FEB-1989 16:27

.  2. SIMULATING TEST OF PANEL UNDER MONOTONICALLY INCREASING
.     LOADS Nx, Ny, Nxy, and p:  (Analysis type ITYPE = 3)
.
.      In March, 1989 PANDA2 was further enhanced by modification of
.      the three processors, STORE, CHPLOT, and DIPLOT, mentioned above.
.      The STORE.NEW library has two main subroutines, STORE1 and STORE2.
.      STORE1 performs the tasks described above. STORE2 stores data from
.      every load increment.  In using this new capability, the user
.      reruns MAINSETUP, answering questions about load increments, maximum
.      number of increments, and (load set, subcase) for which he/she wants
.      results.  Then the user runs PANDAOPT.  PANDAOPT finds the state of
.      the panel for all load increments until general instability and/or
.      wide column buckling occur.  Files resulting from the two new
.      commands, CHOOSEPLOT and DIPLOT (for a particular case called BLADE)
.      are:
.
.           BLADE.CPL;6               6/9       21-MAR-1989 06:10

.                SETUP generates a NAME.ALL file that represents a
.                single module of the panel.   PANEL generates a
.                NAME.ALL file that represents a multi-module panel.
.                The single-module NAME.ALL file is used by the PANDA2
.                system as input to the BOSMODEL processor. The multi-
.                module NAME.ALL file is used by the PANDA2 system as
.                input to the BOSORALL processor, which is a BOSOR4
.                processor.

?
*
.  BEG           (NAME.BEG  file)       FILE TYPE:  FORMATTED
.
.      NAME.BEG  contains a summary of the interactive session
.                initiated with the command BEGIN (establish starting
.                design). This file can be edited and used for future
.                runs of the BEGIN processor, thus saving you the
.                necessity of running through all the questions again
.                interactively.  Partial NAME.BEG files are also use-
.                ful:  If you make a mistake during the interactive
.                session, you can terminate with a CONTROL Y, remove
.                any erroneous lines at the end of the NAME.BEG file,
.                and issue the command BEGIN again. Upon your indicat-
.                ing that you want to add to an existing file, the
.                BEGIN processor will use the data in the NAME.BEG
.                file first and return to the interactive mode at the
.                end of this file. The data that you next provide will
.                be added to the NAME.BEG file.

> DAT
?
*
.  DAT           (NAME.DAT  file)       FILE TYPE:  FORMATTED
.
.      NAME.DAT  contains a copy of whatever interactive session is
.                presently being performed or has just been performed.
.                This file is generally not
.                needed, but may be useful in case of accidental
.                distruction of the other file that contains the current
.                interactive session (NAME.BEG, NAME.DEC, NAME.OPT, or
.                NAME.CHG, for examples).  Also, NAME.DAT contains
.                updated annotations, so that if your input file,
.                NAME.BEG, NAME.DEC, NAME.OPT, NAME.CHG, etc. was
.                generated via an old version of PANDA2 or in some
.                other way than by interactive processing, and therefore
.                has incomplete or inappropriate (out-of-date) annotations,
.                you can produce a properly annotated input file by
.                renaming the NAME.DAT file to NAME.BEG, NAME.DEC, or
.                whatever is appropriate. Make sure you check NAME.DAT
.                first to ensure that it has the proper data.
.
.                If you are planning to use the NAME.DAT file to replace
.                one of your earlier input files, make sure that you do it
.                right after you have run the appropriate processor
.                in the "batch" (correcting, adding to) mode. For example,
.                if you want to update your NAME.BEG file, run BEGIN,
.                check your NAME.DAT file, and if NAME.DAT is okay, copy
.                it into NAME.BEG right away before you run any other
.                PANDA2 processors.  NAME.DAT is destroyed at the
.                beginning of all new processes.

.                variables). This file can be edited and used for future
.                runs of the DECIDE processor, thus saving you the
.                necessity of running through all the questions again
.                interactively.  Partial NAME.DEC files are also use-

.  OPB           (NAME.OPB  file)       FILE TYPE:  FORMATTED
.
.      NAME.OPB  contains a summary of output from BEGIN.  It is a
.                good idea to list this file before proceeding with
.                any optimization in order to insure that the case is
.                as you intend it to be.

.      NAME.OPD  contains a summary of output from DECIDE.  It is a
.                good idea to list this file before proceeding with
.                any optimization in order to insure that the case is

*
:
> OPM
?
*
.  OPM           (NAME.OPM  file)       FILE TYPE:  FORMATTED
.
.      NAME.OPM  contains output from the PANDA2 mainprocessor,
.                PANDAOPT.  This is the most important file of all
.                from the user's viewpoint, because it contains
.                warping evaluation, bowing due to loading, general
.                and local bifurcation buckling loads, the postbuckled
.                state of strain and stress resultants, identification
.                of maximum strains and strain margins, and the evolu-
.                tion of the design during optimization.
.
.                NOTE: make sure you print this file out after every
.                      PANDAOPT batch run.  The PANDA2 system only
.                      retains the most recent version of NAME.OPM.
*
:
> OPT
?
*
.  OPT           (NAME.OPT  file)       FILE TYPE:  FORMATTED
.
.      NAME.OPT  contains a summary of the short interactive session
.                following your command MAINSETUP.  The contents of
.                this file are listed at the beginning of NAME.OPM.
.                The file is always saved, and you do not have to
.                go back to MAINSETUP every time you want to launch
.                a batch run via your command PANDAOPT.  For example,
.                after looking at the results of the first set of
.                design iterations in the file NAME.OPM, you may want
.                to do another set of design iterations without
.                changing any strategy parameters. If so, you can
.                simply type PANDAOPT again.  The PANDA2 system will
.                use the strategy parameters in the file NAME.OPT.
*
:
> CHG
?
*
.  CHG           (NAME.CHG  file)       FILE TYPE:  FORMATTED
.
.      NAME.CHG  contains a summary of the interactive session
.                initiated with the command CHANGE (modify design).
.                This file can be edited and used for future
.                runs of the CHANGE processor, thus saving you the
.                necessity of running through all the questions again
.                interactively.  Partial NAME.CHG files are also use-
.                ful:  If you make a mistake during the interactive
.                session, you can terminate with a CONTROL Y, remove
.                any erroneous lines at the end of the NAME.CHG file,
.                and issue the command CHANGE again. Upon your indicat-
.                ing that you want to add to an existing file, the
.                CHANGE processor will use the data in the NAME.CHG
.                file first and return to the interactive mode at the
.                end of this file. The data that you next provide will
.                be added to the NAME.CHG file.

.  OPC           (NAME.OPC  file)       FILE TYPE:  FORMATTED
.
.      NAME.OPC  contains a summary of output from CHANGE.  It is a
.                good idea to list this file before proceeding with
.                any optimization in order to insure that the case is
.                as you intend it to be.  Also, if you have made
.                substantial changes, it is a good idea before doing
.                any optimization, to run a simple buckling analysis
.                with the new design fixed.

.   HOW TO RUN PANDA2...
.
.      To operate PANDA2 you must have the BOSOR4 program system on
.      a subdirectory with the name BOSOR4.  The PANDA2 system uses
.      many of the libraries from the BOSOR4 system, and certain
.      commands (for example PANEL followed by BOSORALL) use the
.      BOSOR4 processors in toto.
.
.      You first activate PANDA2 commands via the command PANDA2LOG.
.      This command must be given before you do any PANDA2 work.
. 
.      NOTE:  You must include the following four statements in your
.             LOGIN.COM:
.
.            $ASSIGN userdisk:[username.PANDA2] PANDA2
.            $PANDA2LOG :== @userdisk:[username.PANDA2]PANDA2
.            $ASSIGN userdisk:[username.BOSOR4] BOSOR4
.            $BOSOR4LOG :== @userdisk:[username.BOSOR4]BOSOR4
.
.      The most important processors in the PANDA2 system are BEGIN,
.      DECIDE, MAINSETUP, and PANDAOPT.  New users should use the
.      tutorial option the first time they use PANDA2. The list
.      output produced via tutorial runs can then be saved for future
.      reference.  Details as to purpose of PANDA2 and theory are
.      included in the tutorials, as well as more complete explanations
.      of the input data called for than are ordinarily provided as
.      prompts for the user.
.
.      You then prepare input data interactively via the BEGIN command.
.      These data establish a starting design, material properties,
.      temperature rise pertaining to residual stresses from curing,
.      and in-plane loading.  A summary of the data that you provided
.      interactively is stored on a file NAME.BEG, which you will find
.      very useful in future analyses of the same design concept. (NAME
.      is a name that you choose and stick with for the entire case.)
.
.      You next type the command SETUP.
.
.      A BOSOR4-type of input data file is created by your typing the
.      command SETUP. Following SETUP, you type the command BOSMODEL.
.      This launches a batch run of a BOSOR4-type preprocessor which
.      is almost identical to BOSORREAD (see HELP4 PROGRAMS in the
.      BOSOR4 subdirectory).
.
.      The BOSMODEL processor creates a discretized model of a single
.      module of the panel (see PURPOSE). When the BOSMODEL batch run
.      is finished, you can either type the command DECIDE or the
.      command MAINSETUP.  If you choose DECIDE, you will be asked
.      to pick decision variables and their upper and lower bounds,
.      linked variables and linking constants, and escape variables.
.      If you choose MAINSETUP, you will be asked to provide strategy
.      parameters for a simple buckling analysis of a fixed design.
.
.      Suppose you choose DECIDE.  This choice means that you intend to
.      do an optimization analysis.  After picking decision variables
.      and other optimization parameters in DECIDE, you type the command
.      MAINSETUP.  Now you establish certain strategy parameters for the
.      buckling and optimization analyses.
.
.      You then type the command PANDAOPT, which launches a batch run
.      of the PANDA2 mainprocessor. Simple buckling analyses require
.      up to a minute on the VAX 11/780, and 6 to 10 design iterations
.      in an optimization analysis require about 10 to 20 minutes of
.      CPU time.  The results of the PANDAOPT run are stored in a file
.      called NAME.OPM.
.
.      After inspecting the NAME.OPM file, you may wish to do more
.      design iterations.  If you feel the strategy parameters esta-
.      blished in MAINSETUP are still good, simply type the command
.      PANDAOPT again. Look at the new NAME.OPM file. Keep repeating
.      this cycle until you have a satisfactory design. If along the
.      way you want to change the strategy parameters, type MAINSETUP
.      again.  If you want to change which parameters are decision
.      variables or upper or lower bounds, or if you want to change
.      the linking variables or linking constants of proportionality,
.      type DECIDE again.
.
.      At any time, if you want to establish temperature-dependent
.      material properties, you can now use the command CHOOSETEMP.
.      CHOOSETEMP allows you to provide modification factors for
.      any property or properties of any material. These factors
.      are a function of temperature. For each property that is
.      temperature-dependent, you provide a "table" of modification
.      factor v. temperature.  PANDA2 uses linear interpolation to
.      establish the modification factors at intermediate temperatures.
,      Please see ITEM 38 of PANDA2.NEWS for more information.
.
.   All the analysis up to this point is for a single panel module.
.   You will want to check the accuracy of the
.   general instability load factor (eigenvalue) from the single-
.   module analysis by comparing it with the general instability
.   load factor from a multi-module model that represents the entire
.   panel.  This you do by typing the commands PANEL, BOSOR4LOG,
.   BOSORALL, and BOSORPLOT, in that order.  PANEL is like SETUP,
.   except that it sets up an input data file, NAME.ALL, for a
.   multi-module panel.  This file is a regular BOSOR4 input data
.   file.  The command BOSOR4LOG activates the BOSOR4 command set,
.   and the command BOSORALL initiates a batch run of the BOSOR4
.   pre-, main-, and postprocessors.  BOSORPLOT gets plots of the
.   discretized multi-module panel and of buckling modes.
.
.   The user can get plots of design variables, design margins,
.   and objective v. design iterations from the beginning of the
.   case (from the first PANDAOPT command and including all
.   subsequent PANDAOPT commands).  The new capability is
.   incorporated into three new processors, STORE, CHPLOT, and
.   DIPLOT.  Two new commands, CHOOSEPLOT, and DIPLOT have been
.   added to the PANDA2 command set.  See HELPAN COMMANDS,
.   HELPAN FILES GENERAL, HELPAN LIBRARIES, and HELPAN PROGRAMS
.   for more information.  Also see Items 28 and 32 of PANDA2.NEWS.
.
.   For a fixed design, you can get plots of the behavior of any
.   panel as a function of load. Again, you use the new commands,
.   CHOOSEPLOT and DIPLOT.  The file SAMPLE.CAS demonstrates.
.   Also see ITEM 32 of PANDA2.NEWS.
.
.   There is a new PANDA2 processor called STAGSMODEL which can
.   be used to generate an input file, NAME.INP, suitable for use
.   with the STAGS computer program and the STAGS postprocessor.
.
.   You can get design sensitivity curves (ITYPE = 4) and
.   load interaction curves (ITYPE = 5) with PANDA2. See
.   "IMPROVEMENTS TO PANDA2", vol. 1, revised November 1991
.   for examples.
.
.   See PANDA2.NEWS for current doings with PANDA2, including

.    PANDA2 ABSTRACT...
.
.   The purpose of PANDA2 is to find the minimum weight design of  a  stif-
.   fened  panel made of laminated composite material.  The panel is loaded
.   by combinations of in-plane loads, Nx, Ny, and Nxy, in which Nx is the
.   load  in the axial direction (negative for compression).  PANDA2 repre-
.   sents a more detailed treatment of  certain  behavior  not  handled  by
.   PANDA  [1],  in particular the design of panels loaded so that the skin
.   between stiffeners is locally buckled and panels with hat shaped  stif-
.   feners and panels with TRUSS-CORE sandwich construction. 
.
.   In addition, PANDA2 will handle nonlinear static response to
.   normal pressure and will design the panel for up to 5 sets of in-plane
.   load combinations and normal pressure. The axial load can vary across
.   the span of the panel. Both local and overall (bowing) imperfections
.   are included. The local imperfection is assumed to be in the form of
.   the local buckling mode predicted by a model with a discretized cross
.   section.
.
.   Optimization is carried out based mostly on the behavior of a single
.   panel module.  Such a module is depicted in Fig. 1 under "PURPOSE".
.   A module is the cross section of a stringer plus the skin of width
.   equal to the spacing between stringers.  Other models included in
.   the PANDA2 system include all models discribed in the PANDA system
.   (See Ref. 1, in particular Table 1 and Figs. 1-4 there), and a
.   discretized model of the entire panel width with smeared stiffeners.
.   This last model is used for general instability analysis of panels
.   in which the axial load varies across the span of the panel.
.
.   Constraints on the minimization include: stiffener segment buckling,
.   local skin buckling, general buckling, maximum stress, and other
.   constraints as described in Computers and Structures, V. 25, No. 4,
.   pp 469-605 (1987) and other papers listed under HELPAN OVERVIEW DOC.
.   The structural analysis in PANDA2 is performed via a BOSOR4-like model.
.   The panel module cross section is divided into segments each of which
.   is discretized and anlyzed via the finite difference energy method.
.   Variation of deflection in the axial direction is assumed to be
.   harmonic.  This one-dimensional discretization is identical to that
.   used in the BOSOR programs for shells of revolution.
.
.   In the panels designed by PANDA2 the skin between stringers may
.   buckle well before failure of the panel.  The maximum stress components
.   and therefore stress constraints in the optimization analysis are
.   computed including growth and modification of the local skin buckling
.   mode as predicted by a theory similar to that formulated by Koiter
.   in 1943  [5].
.
.   Information about continuing improvements to PANDA2 is given in
.   the file PANDA2.NEWS.  Also, see PANDA2.TEX.

.    PURPOSE OF PANDA2
.
.   The purpose of PANDA2 is to find the minimum weight design of  a  stif-
.   fened  panel made of laminated composite material.  The panel is loaded
.   by  combinations of in-plane loads, Nx, Ny, and Nxy, in which Nx is the
.   load  in the axial direction (negative for compression).  PANDA2 repre-
.   sents a more detailed treatment of  certain  behavior  not  handled  by
.   PANDA  [1],  in particular the design of panels loaded so that the skin
.   between stiffeners is locally buckled and panels with hat shaped  stif-
.   feners and panels with truss-core sandwich construction.
.
.   In addition, PANDA2 will handle nonlinear static response to
.   normal pressure and will design the panel for up to 5 sets of in-plane
.   load combinations and normal pressure. The axial load can vary across
.   the span of the panel. Local and global imperfections are included.
.
.   Optimization is carried out based mostly on the behavior of a single
.   panel module.  Such a module is depicted in Fig. 1 below.
.   A module is the cross section of a stringer plus the skin of width
.   equal to the spacing between stringers.  Other models included in
.   the PANDA2 system include all models discribed in the PANDA system
.   (See Ref. 1, in particular Table 1 and Figs. 1-4 there), and a
.   discretized model of the entire panel width with smeared stiffeners.
.   This last model is used for general instability analysis of panels
.   in which the axial load varies across the span of the panel.

.
.
.
.   Optimization is carried out mostly for a single module.  Constraints on
.   the  minimization  include:   stiffener  segment  crippling, local skin
.   buckling, general buckling, and maximum  strain.   Symmetry  conditions
.   are  applied  at  the left and right edges of the single module.  After
.   the optimum design is obtained, you can check the accuracy of the  gen-
.   eral instability load predicted from the single-module model by running
.   a multi-module model with BOSOR4 [2].  The input  data  file  for  this
.   multi-module model is generated automatically by the PANDA2 system.
.
.        As with PANDA, the program PANDA2 consists of several independent-
.   ly  executable  processors which share a common data base.  In the pro-
.   cessor BEGIN you supply a starting design (perhaps a design produced by
.   PANDA).   In  DECIDE you choose decision variables for the optimization
.   analysis and their upper and lower bounds;  you  choose  linking  vari-
.   ables  and  their  factors of proportionality;  and you choose "escape"
.   variables (explained below).  In MAINSETUP you choose strategy  parame-
.   ters such as number and range of axial half-waves in the local buckling
.   mode, number of design iterations in the optimization problem, and fac-
.   tors of safety for general instability and maximum strain.  In PANDAOPT
.   you cause the analysis to be performed.  PANDAOPT consists of two  main
.   branches:   in one branch the structural analyses (stress, buckling and
.   postbuckling) are performed and in the other new designs  are  produced
.   by the optimizer ADS, written by Gary Vanderplaats [6].
.
.        The structural analysis in PANDA2 is performed via  a  BOSOR4-like
.   model.  The panel module cross section is divided into segments each of
.   which is discretized and analyzed  via  the  finite  difference  energy
.   method.   Variation of deflection in the axial direction (normal to the
.   plane of the screen in Fig.  1) is assumed to be harmonic [sin(n*theta)
.   or  cos(n*theta)].  This one-dimensional discretization is identical to
.   that used in the BOSOR programs for the analysis of shells  of  revolu-
.   tion.  In fact, many of the subroutines for buckling and vibration ana-
.   lysis are taken from BOSOR4 and modified slightly.  The modification is
.   necessary  to  handle prismatic structures instead of shells of revolu-
.   tion.  Both local and general instability can be handled with the  same
.   structural model.  This model will also handle rolling of the stiffener
.   with and without skin participation.  Symmetry conditions  are  imposed
.   at  the beginning of Segment 1 and at the end of Segment 5.  (Note that
.   in the BOSOR4 model of the single- module cross  section,  the  segment
.   denoted  "segment 1 again" in Fig.  1 is Segment 5.  It is called "seg-
.   ment 1 again" in Fig.  1 because its properties are identical to  those
.   of Segment 1.)

.      the same name. The difference has to do with the location of
.      the "extra" nodal points next to the ends of each structural
.      segment.  Because of numerical integrations with
.      Simpson's method used for the calculation of certain
.      coefficients for Koiter's postbuckling theory, these "extra"
.      nodal points in the PANDA2 models are located half way between
.      existing points, which are spaced unevenly so that in the final
.      model the nodal point spacing is uniform throughout each
.      segment.  Execution of B4READ sets up templates needed for assembly
.      of the global stiffness and load-geometric matrices in the bifurcation
.      buckling problem. It also establishes arc length measures and
.      other quantities required for plotting the cross section.
.      B4READ generates random access files NAME.RN1 and NAME.RN2 and
.      sequential access files NAME.BL1 and NAME.BL2 for use later on.

.      use in the local buckling analysis, what factors of safety to
.      use for general instability and for maximum strain, how many
.      design iterations the batch run should allow, and should
.      Koiter's postbuckling theory be used.  The interactive session
.      is saved on a small file NAME.OPT, which is printed out at the

.
.    1. OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS (ITYPE = 1):

.      way which design variables and design margins to plot v.
.      design iterations from the beginning of the case. The files
.      *.PLD, *.TIT, and *.Pij (see HELPAN FILES GENERAL) generated

.      See SAMPLE.CAS as an example.
.
.    2. TEST SIMULATION ANALYSIS OF OPTIMIZED PANEL (ITYPE = 3):

.      way which behaviors and design margins and undeformed panel
.      modules and deformed panel modules and layer type allocations
.      and "3-D" plots to obtain vs. load steps on a panel of fixed
.      design. The files *.PL2, *.TTT, and *.Lij (see HELPAN FILES

.    ARRAYS
.
.      Similar to a BOSOR4 library of the same name, this library
.      sets up the stiffness and load-geometric matrices for the
.      bifurcation buckling (eigenvalue) problem of the single panel
.      module and of the entire panel with smeared stiffeners.
.      The single panel module is modelled as a prismatic structure with
.      variation of displacement trigonometric along the axis and with
.      the cross section segmented and discretized according to BOSOR4
.      conventions.  The strain-displacement relations have been
.      modified from those used in BOSOR4 to account for the fact that
.      the panel module is not an axisymmetric structure but a
.      prismatic structure.  For example, the radius from the axis of
.      revolution no longer occurs and differentiation by theta in
.      BOSOR4 becomes differentiation with respect to the axial
.      coordinate in PANDA2. Hence, whereas in BOSOR4 differentiation
.      with respect to the circumferential coordinate theta was
.      represented by multiplication by the circumferential wavenumber
.      n; in PANDA2 differentiation with respect to the axial
.      coordinate is represented by multiplication by the factor n*pi/L,
.      in which n is the number of axial half waves and L is the length
.      of the panel in the axial direction.

.    KOITER THEORY LIMITATIONS...
.
.      The modified Koiter theory for local postbuckling simply uses
.      as the number of axial half waves whatever corresponded to the
.      minimum bifurcation buckling load factor. Thus, no allowance is
.      made here for change in axial wavelength in the locally post-
.      buckled regime. In some tests abrupt changes in number of axial
.      waves is observed as the axial load is increased. No such
.      post-post buckling behavior is modelled in PANDA2.
.
.      As of this writing (January, 1987) the Koiter theory applies
.      only to flat panels. The theory MAY be accurate enough for
.      cylindrical panels if at and near optimum designs the stringers are
.      close enough together so that the curvature can be neglected
.      in determinations of the locally post-buckled state. This is a
.      major weakness of PANDA2, and usually leads to unconservative
.      results in the locally postbuckling behavior of cylindrical panels
.      and shells.  PANDA2 does not work well for the prediction of the
.      development of diagonal tension in locally postbuckled cylindrical
.      panels under loading in which in-plane shear predominates.
.
*
:
> WIDE
?
*
.    The wide column buckling model may on occasion be too conservative
.    to be useful.  For example, neglect of the curvature in buckling
.    analyses of monocoque, axially compressed cylinders is clearly
.    too conservative. The wide column estimate is particularly
.    appropriate for buckling of rather short cylinders (length about
.    equal to the radius or shorter) with axial stiffening. The length
.    of cylinder between rings is often such a cylinder. If you are
.    analyzing a cylinder stiffened by both rings and stringers, and
.    you indicate that you want the wide column model to constrain
.    the design, please note that it is the portion of cylinder between
.    rings that is being modeled with the wide column model, NOT the
.    entire cylinder. The general instability loads of the complete
.    cylinder are calculated from a PANDA-type ("closed form") model,
.    and it is best for you to provide sufficient knockdown factors
.    to produce a safe design.  For guidance on knockdown factors
.    please see COMPUTERIZED BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF SHELLS, published
.    by Nijhoff, The Netherlands, 1985.

.   The effect of in-plane shear loading is handled in a rougher
.   manner than the other PANDA2 calculations. For PANDA-type of
.   calculations, see Ref. 1 for a description of how in-plane shear
.   is handled. Results of the Rayleigh-Ritz type of analysis in PANDA
.   are not too bad, as demonstrated by many comparisons in Ref. 1. For
.   the BOSOR4 types of analyses (discretized panel cross sections),
.   in-plane shear is handled by calculating the buckling load without
.   in-plane shear, then knocking it down by the factor
.        (buckling load from PANDA with shear)/(same without shear).
.   This practical solution seems to work well in most cases for which the
.   answer is known, especially for flat panels and for panels in which
.   the in-plane shear loading component does not predominate.  It does
.   NOT work well in the case of cylindrical panels in which the shear
.   load component predominates
.
.   The prediction of diagonal tension in locally postbuckled cylindrical
.   panels (both stiffened and unstiffened) under predominately in-plane
.   shear loading is poor with PANDA2, probably because of the poor
.   assumption as of this writing (January 1987) concerting postbuckling
.   mode shape:  w = f(phi + a*phi**3). If the panel is curved, another
.   term should be included: w = f(phi + b*phi**2 + a*phi**3). The
.   b*phi**2 term is not yet included.

.    If the axial load varies across the span of the panel (across the
.    plane of the screen), it must vary linearly. The axial load cannot
.    vary in the direction normal to the plane of the screen.
. 
.    Only uniform normal pressure can be accommodated by PANDA2.
.
*
:
> CURV
?
*
.    In the analysis of a single panel module, the effect of curvature
.    is neglected.  Hence, in the IQUICK = 0 analysis branches, local
.    instability and wide column buckling are calculated neglecting
.    panel curvature. Curvature is included in the PANDA-type of analysis
.    and in the analysis of the entire panel with smeared stiffeners for
.    the case when the axial load varies across the span of the panel.
.
.    Please see other subtopics under CAUTION for more about curved
.    panels.
.
.    The curvature enters the picture also in the analysis of the multi-
.    module panel. (see HELPAN COMMAND PANEL).
