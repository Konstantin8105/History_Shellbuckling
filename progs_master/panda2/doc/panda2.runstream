PANDA2 RUN STREAM STARTING FROM SCRATCH

Optimization of an aluminum hydrostatically compressed
cylindrical shell with T-shaped stringers and T-shaped rings

The user-provided name of the case is: cylstif


INTRODUCTION

This file is long because in it are described not only executions
of PANDA2 but also executions of BIGBOSOR4 and STAGS. BIGBOSOR4,
a shell-of-revolution analyzer, and STAGS, a general-purpose code,
are used to verify PANDA2 predictions for the T-stringer and
T-ring stiffened cylindrical shell optimized by PANDA2. PANDA2
has processors, PANEL and PANEL2, which produce valid input files
for BIGBOSOR4, and STAGSUNIT, which produces valid input files for
STAGS. The example, a hydrostatically compressed cylindrical shell
with T-shaped stringers and with T-shaped rings, is complex. The
optimized design exhibits many different kinds of buckling:
general buckling, inter-ring buckling, local buckling, as well as
various types of buckling of the T-shaped stringers and T-shaped
rings.


SUMMARY

This report consists of three parts:

PART 1.0;
First, we find from PANDA2 an optimum design of an imperfect T-stringer
and T-ring stiffened cylindrical shell made of aluminum. The T-stiffened
cylindrical shell is 300 inches long and has a radius of 100 inches.
The T-stringers are external and the T-rings are internal. The loading
is uniform axial compression, Nx = p x r/2, and uniform circumferential
compression, Ny = p x r, in which p is the uniform external pressure. The
imperfection is in the form of the general buckling mode. After we find an
optimum design via two executions of the PANDA2 processor called SUPEROPT,
we obtain predictions for that same optimum design from an analysis in which
the amplitude of the general buckling modal imperfection is set equal to
zero.

PART 2.0:
Second, we use the PANDA2 processors, PANEL and PANEL2, to set up
BIGBOSOR4 models, then run BIGBOSOR4 and compare results with the
predictions from PANDA2 for the optimized design. The shell is perfect.

PART 3.0:
Third, we use the PANDA2 processor, STAGSUNIT, to set up STAGS models,
then compare the results from STAGS with predictions from BIGBOSOR4
and PANDA2 for the optimized design. The shell is perfect.

PART 1.1: Activate the PANDA2 commands

bush-> panda2log

PANDA2 commands have been activated.

PANDA2 commands are:
begin      - you provide a starting design, material properties, boundary conditions
choosetemp - choose temparature dependence
setup      - PANDA2 generates BOSOR4-type matrix skylines for use by PANDA2
decide     - you choose decision variables, lower and upper bounds, linking relationships
mainsetup  - you provide loading, imperfection amplitudes, fact.of safety, analysis type, strategy
pandaopt   - launch run of mainprocessor for a single set of design iterations
superopt   - launch run for multiple sets of design iterations (obtain a global optimum design)
change     - assign new values to parameters (or save an optimum design)
autochange - assign new vector of decision variables randomly (used in the superopt process)
chooseplot - choose which variables/margins to plot
diplot     - generate & print PostScript file containing plots
panel      - generate BOSOR4 input for a skin-stringer multi-module model
panel2     - generate BOSOR4 input for a skin-ring multi-module model
panel3     - generate BOSOR4 input for a skin-stringer + weld land multi-module model
stagsmodel - generate STAGS input for panel (element unit, no rings)
stagsunit  - generate STAGS input for panel (shell units, both rings and stringers permitted)
cleanpan   - delete temporary case-specific files

 A typical PANDA2 runstream is:
   begin
   setup
   decide
   mainsetup
   superopt  (or pandaopt)
   (several more pandaopts if the previous command is not superopt)
   chooseplot
   diplot
   change
   superopt or pandaopt
   etc.
   cleanpan

Please consult the files in .../panda2/doc for more information about PANDA2.
Also review the sample cases in .../panda2/case.
Also read the published papers listed in the file .../panda2/doc/panda2.ref.
The file, .../panda2/doc/panda2.news contains updates and comments since 1987.
Useful annotation appears in the *.OPM file when NPRINT = 2 in the *.OPT file.

USEFUL HINT PERTAINING TO THE INTERACTIVE INPUT YOU SHOULD PROVIDE DURING 'mainsetup':
 After you type the command, 'mainsetup', try just hitting ENTER to obtain the default value
 of any data entry that you are unsure about. PANDA2 will provide what its developer
 usually chooses. Generally use 5 iterations/pandaopt; Generally use NPRINT = 0;
 Generally use 'superopt'; Generally choose 5 pandaopts per autochange for superopt runs.

USEFUL HINT FOR SAVING OPTIMUM DESIGNS FOR FUTURE RUNS:
 Once you have obtained a global optimum design that you are happy with, execute the
 process called 'change' in order to save this global optimum design in a file called *.CHG
 Then the global optimum design will be preserved in the *.CHG file after execution of 'cleanpan'.
 You can then execute 'change' immediately following 'begin' in order to re-establish
 that same global optimum design at any time in the future.

FILES THAT ARE PRESERVED FOLLOWING EXECUTION OF THE COMMAND, 'cleanpan':
 *.BEG (from 'begin'), *.DEC (from 'decide'), *.OPT (from 'mainsetup'), *.CHG (from 'change')
 *.CPL (from 'chooseplot'), *.PAN (from 'panel' or 'panel2'), *.STG (from 'stagsunit'
 or from 'stagsmodel'). These preserved files are valid input for the interactive processors,
 begin, decide, mainsetup, change, chooseplot, panel or panel2, stagsunit or stagsmodel,
 respectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


PART 1.2: Execute the PANDA2 processor called "BEGIN" in
          order to establish a starting design, material
          properties, boundary conditions.

bush-> begin
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


 ****************   BEGIN   ******************

 Purpose of BEGIN is to permit you to provide a starting design
 in an interactive mode. You give starting dimensions, material
 properties, allowables. The interactive session is stored on a
 file called cylstif.BEG, in which cylstif is a name that you have
 chosen for the case.(cylstif must remain the same as you use all
 the PANDA2 processors.)  In future runs of the same or a
 slightly modified case, you will find it convenient to use the
 file cylstif.BEG as input.  Rather than answer all the questions
 interactively, you can use cylstif.BEG or an edited version of
 cylstif.BEG as input to BEGIN.  BEGIN also generates an output
 file called cylstif.OPB. cylstif.OPB lists a summary of the case,
 and if you choose the tutorial option, the questions, helps,
 and your answers for each input datum.

 *************************************************

 Are you correcting, adding to, or using an existing file?=n
 n
 Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?=n
 n

 Now you start to provide input data. You will be prompted by
 short questions. If you need help, just type H as an
 answer to the prompt instead of the datum called for. In most
 instances you will then be given more information on the datum
 you must provide. It may be a good idea to run the tutorial
 option if you are a new user of PANDA2.

 Overall panel dimensions:
   1. length normal to the plane of the screen, L1
   2. length in the plane of the screen,        L2

 SOME ADVICE ON MODELING WHEN NORMAL PRESSURE IS PRESENT:
 If you are designing a panel that has both stringers and rather
 large rings, and you expect that in the prebuckling phase there
 may be significant bending between these large rings due to the
 pressure, then set up models in which there are stringers only,
 or stringers and weak rings. ("weak" implies that the normal
 pressure does not cause significant local axial bending between
 them.) The entire axial length of each model must be equal to the
 spacing of the large rings. The boundary conditions along the
 edges where the large rings are supposed to be should be clamped
 for the prebuckling phase and simply supported for the buckling
 phase of the analysis if the stringers are not tapered in the
 neighborhoods of the large rings.  If the stringers are tapered
 near the large rings, then use simple support for both the
 prebuckling and the buckling phases of the analysis.

 Panel length normal to the plane of the screen, L1=h

 This is the axial length of the panel. For a cylindrical panel,
 this is the length of the generator of the panel. This is the
 x - direction.

 Panel length normal to the plane of the screen, L1=300
       300
 Panel length in the plane of the screen, L2=h

 For a cylindrical panel, this is the arc length along the
 circumference of the entire panel.  A complete cylindrical
 shell can be modelled by using  L2 = pi*radius. Then the number
 of half-waves over this circumferential length is the same as
 the number of full waves around the complete 360 degree circum-
 ference.  If you are analyzing a complete cylindrical shell,
 especially one with loads that vary around the circumference,
 it will probably be best to divide it into panels. Then analyze
 the panel as a structure subjected to multiple sets of uniform
 loads.  (See the paper, PANDA2--program for minimum weight
 design of stiffened, composite, locally buckled panels, for an
 example. Computers and Structures, Vol. 25, pp 570-574, Fig. 79)

 Panel length in the plane of the screen, L2=314.16
   314.1600

 The stiffened panel is considered to be divided into several
 identical modules, as follows:
          ___                  ___                   ___
           |                    |                     |
           |                    |                     |
 --------=====----------------=====-----------------=====---------
 |<---Module No. 1-->|<-- Module No. 2 --->|<--- Module No. 3 -->|

 For a module you will be asked to provide the following data:
    1. width,  b, of the module (same as stiffener spacing)
    2. width, b2, of the thickened region at the base of the
       stiffener (shown as ====== above).
    3. height, h, of the stiffener
    4. width,  w, of the outstanding flange of the stiffener, if any
    5. number of unique segments in the module (4 in above figure)
    6. For each unique segment of the module:
        6.1 number of layers thru thickness
        6.2 layer type indicator for each layer
        6.3 For each new layer type:
              6.3.1 thickness
              6.3.2 winding angle (which means layup angle)
              6.3.3 material type indicator

 Identify type of stiffener along L1 (N,T,J,Z,R,A,C,G)=h

 L1 is the length of the panel normal to the plane of the screen.
 For choice "G" (isoGrid) L1 is irrelevant.

 N = no stiffeners along L1 at all
 T = T-shaped cross section
 J = J-shaped cross section (or angle with flange away from skin)
 Z = Z-shaped cross section with riveted faying flange
 R = rectangular cross section (blade stiffener)
 A = hat-shaped or trapezoidal cross section (enclosing area)
 C = Truss-core sandwich construction (added July 1989)
 G = isoGrid (added September 1992). With isoGrid the stiffeners
     can be T-shaped, J-shaped, or rectangular (blade).

 stiffener spacing, b=30
        30
 width of stringer base, b2 (must be > 0, see Help)=h

 Width b2 must be greater than zero.  In fact, it should always
 be greater than a tenth of the module width, b. This segment of
 the module is considered by PANDA2 to consist of the skin plus
 the faying flange, if any, of the stiffener. In the PANDA2
 model b2 must be greater than about a tenth of the total module
 width, b, because the section of width b2 is considered to be
 a separate segment which is discretized. If you make b2 too
 small, numerical difficulties might occur.

 If the panel skin in the width b2 has the SAME CONSTRUCTION
 as that outside this region, set b2 to a value about b/3. IN
 THIS CASE, IN "DECIDE" MAKE SURE TO LINK THE WIDTH OF b2 TO
 THE SPACING, b:
                   b2 = C*b

 Are the stringers cocured with the skin?=h

 Stringers and skin may be cured separately, then glued
 together at room temperature, or they may be cocured. Which
 method is used very much affects the residual stresses and
 residual deformations of the panel. The residual stresses
 and deformations in cocured panels are caused by the different
 thermal expansion properties of the stringers and skin as the
 panel cools down from the curing temperature to room tempera-
 ture. If this is not a composite panel, the answer here should
 probably be N.

 Are the stringers cocured with the skin?=n
 n
 What force/(axial length) will cause web peel-off?=h

 Irrelevant for ISOGRID configuration.

 Wanted here is the force-per-axial-length of stringer required
 to peel half of each stringer web and faying flange away from the
 panel skin. "Half the stringer web" means half of the thickness.
 It is assumed that each half of the stringer web consists of
 layers that start as part or all of the faying flange on either
 side of the stiffener. These layers "turn a corner" to become
 the stringer web. Tensile forces in the plane of the web,
 normal to the stringer axis, will therefore tend to peel the
 web halves from the faying flanges from which they derive.
 In the post-local buckling regime, such forces develop in each
 stringer web. These are calculated by PANDA2, and a constraint
 condition is formulated that indicates whether or not stringer
 popoff will occur because of web-peel-off caused by post-local
 buckling deformations. The force required here depends on what
 sort of adhesive is used between stringers and skin and its
 thickness.  You will probably have to consult peel test data for
 this input datum.  Units required are force/length.  A typical
 value for graphite-epoxy is in the range 40-100 lb/in. Figures
 5 and 6 of the paper, ``PANDA2--program for minimum weight
 design of stiffened, composite, locally buckled panels" show
 the phenomenon just described and a peel-test specimen.  Figure
 7 is a photograph of a graphite-epoxy peel test specimen after
 failure.

 What force/(axial length) will cause web peel-off?=1000000.
   1000000.

 Now you will be asked to provide properties for the panel
 module on a segment-by-segment basis, starting with the
 skin, which is Segment 1, as shown in the Figure above.
 In each segment of the module, the wall is considered to be
 divided into groups of layers. There are two types of groups:
  1. default groups (12 layers, [90,0,45,-45,0,90]s, all of the
     same material and initially all of the same thickness.
     If you choose this option, winding angles cannot be decision
     variables. Thicknesses can be decision variables.);
  2. just plain groups (any number of layers, any winding angles,
     any variety of material types and any variety of thickness.
     Winding angles CAN be decision variables.)
 For each default group (group type 1) you will be asked to give:
  1. the thickness of one of the layers;
  2. the material type.
 For each "just plain group" (group type 2) you must provide:
  1. the number of layers through the thickness of the group
  2. whether the winding angles can ever be decision variables
  3. layer indices for each layer
  4. whether the layer is a new type of layer
  5. if it is a new type of layer: thickness, winding angle,
     and material type corresponding to that layer index.

 Is the next group of layers to be a "default group" (12 layers!)?=n

 Can winding (layup) angles ever be decision variables?=h

 The term "winding angle" is used throughout PANDA2. However,
 PANDA2 assumes that the composite laminates are "laid up"
 layer by layer, with each layer having a distinct and constant
 angle between the axial direction (normal to the screen) and
 the direction of the fibers (high modulus direction). Hence,
 the composite structure is not wound but built up
 layer by layer.  Fig. 2 of the journal article on PANDA shows
 the geometry. (See the article, "PANDA--interactive program
 for minimum weight design of stiffened cylindrical panels and
 shells", Computers and Structures, vol 16, pp 167-185, 1983)

 Use with caution. Please note that weight does not change with
 winding angle, so that if you plan to optimize something and
 allow winding angles to be decision variables, you must also allow
 the thickness of at least one layer also to be a decision variable.

 Also, any decision variable that is zero or that becomes zero during
 design iterations is dropped by PANDA2 from the list of decision
 variables:  It ceases being a decision variable from that moment on.
 Hence, if you specify that the winding angle of a layer is a decision
 variable, and if you also specify that the winding angle of this
 layer is zero, this layer winding angle will not be a decision
 variable during optimization cycles. If you really want the layer
 winding angle to be a decision variable, set it initially to 5 or 10
 degrees or use CHANGE to change it from zero to 5 or 10 degrees.

 layer index (1,2,...), for layer no.( 1)=h

 A layer index implies the following "bundle" of properties:

    1. thickness of the layer
    2. winding (layup) angle of the layer (degrees between the
       normal to the screen and the direction in which the
       modulus E1 (fiber direction) is measured)
    3. material type of the layer

 The three properties just listed are identical in two different
 layers if both of these layers have the same layer index.

 Next, provide the properties of Segment 2, which is the
 base under the stiffener.  This base includes the skin
 under the stiffener plus the stiffener flange that fays with
 the skin, except in the case of a hat with b2 = w2, for which
 the "base" is simply the laminate under the hat.

 ***** IMPORTANT NOTE *****

 At least one of the layers in Segment 2 should ordinarily be
 the same as one of the layers in Segment 1. If Segment 2
 represents a thickened region under the stiffener, model it as
 being composed of the layers in Segment 1 plus additional layer(s).
 NOTE: There is an exception when the user wants to take advantage
 of "bending overshoot" in stress constraints. For details, see

 choose external (0) or internal (1) stringers=h

 If the panel is flat, choose "external" (0).

 If the panel is cylindrical, choose either 0 or 1.
 See Fig. 8, p. 490, of the long 1987 PANDA2 paper for geometry.
 If you choose 0 ("external"), then the radius of curvature of the
 panel will be regarded as positive. (Referring to the sketch of the
 single panel module, the concave surface of the panel skin will be
 the bottom surface.)  If you choose 1 ("internal)", then the radius
 of curvature of the panel will be regarded as negative. (The bottom
 surface in the panel module sketch will be convex.)

    a. If there are stringers, the ring cross section will lie

       of the skin as the stringers. If stringers and rings are
       on opposite sides of the skin, the ring cross section will
       lie below the panel skin.

 If the panel is cylindrical:
    b. If there are no stringers, the radius of curvature will be
       positive, that is, the concave surface of the panel skin
       will be the bottom surface. (See panel module sketch).

    c. If there are stringers, the sign of the panel curvature is

 and shear stresses in the principle material directions
 (along the fibers and normal to them).

   2 allowables have now been identified.
  50 allowables are permitted.
  48 additional allowables are permitted.


 Sometimes optimum designs are obtained for composite laminates
 with models in which the ENTIRE LAMINATE is treated as one
 layer, rather than on a ply-by-ply basis. Input data for stress
 allowables are generally obtained from membrane and bending tests
 on the ENTIRE LAMINATE. Laminate tests usually reveal that the
 maximum bending stress before failure of the laminate is
 significantly larger than the maximum membrane stress. In order
 to exploit this "bending overshoot" during optimization, it is
 necessary to include stress constraints of the form:

 max.stress constraint = 1/[S(membrane)/S(a) +S(bending)/(f*S(a))]

 in which "S" means "stress" and "a" means "allowable". The quantity
 "f" is a "bending overshoot factor", which might be different for
 as many as five different conditions:

 1. S(membrane) is axial tensile; 2. S(membrane) is axial compressive
 3. S(membrane) is "hoop"tensile: 4. S(membrane) is "hoop"compressive
 5. S(membrane) is in-plane shear stress.

 Accordingly, you will next be prompted whether or not you want to
 take advantage of "bending overshoot". If you answer "Y" and the
 current material does NOT have a single maximum allowable effective
 stress, you will then be prompted for the following five bending
 overshoot factors, fxt, fxc, fyt, fyc, fxy (each greater than unity):
       1. f(axial tensile) =fxt;   2. f(axial compressive) =fxc
       3. f("hoop" tensile)=fyt;   4. f("hoop" compressive)=fyc
       5. f(in-plane shear)=fxy
 "hoop" means normal to the axial direction in the plane of the
 panel module segment (the "s"- or "y"-coordinate in Fig. 9 of the
 long 1987 PANDA2 paper in Computers and Structures, pp 469-605).
 If you have previously indicated that the material has a single
 maximum "effective" stress (in the von Mises sense), then you
 will simply be prompted for one quantity, f, which is the single
 "bending overshoot" factor (greater than unity). NOTE: IF YOU
 ELECT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE "BENDING OVERSHOOT", YOU MUST TREAT
 THIS MATERIAL AS A DIFFERENT MATERIAL IF THE SAME MATERIAL APPEARS
 ELSEWHERE IN A MULTILAYER SEGMENT.

 Is lamina cracking permitted along fibers (type H(elp))?=h

 If this material is isotropic or cloth or has fibers running in
 both directions, answer N.

 If you answer Y, two things will happen in PANDA2:

 1. Cracking due to tension normal to the fiber direction
    will not be treated as failure. Instead, if PANDA2 perceives
    that the allowable stress for tension normal to the fibers
    in a lamina is exceeded, the allowable for compression along
    the fibers in that material at that particular location in
    the laminate will be reduced by half and the allowable for
    in-plane shear will be reduced by 20 per cent.

 2. If during design changes the thickness of any layer made
    of this material becomes less than a quarter of that which
    you give as the minimum thickness (such as .005 in.) the
    layer will disappear.

  If you answer N, even though the material is unidirectional,
  cracking due to tension normal to the fibers will be treated
  as failure, and the layer will never disappear no matter how
  thin it gets during optimization iterations.

 SOME ADVICE ON MODELING WHEN NORMAL PRESSURE IS PRESENT:
 If you are designing a panel that has both stringers and rather
 large rings, and you expect that in the prebuckling phase there
 may be significant bending between these large rings due to the
 pressure, then set up models in which there are stringers only.
 The entire axial length of each model must be equal to the
 spacing of the large rings. The boundary conditions along the
 edges where the large rings are supposed to be should be clamped
 for the prebuckling phase and simply supported for the buckling
 phase of the analysis if the stringers are not tapered in the
 neighborhoods of the large rings.  If the stringers are tapered
 near the large rings, then use simple support for both the
 prebuckling and the buckling phases of the analysis.

 Prebuckling: choose 0=bending included; 2=use membrane theory=h

 What is meant here is the b.c. for the two CURVED boundaries only.
 The straight boundaries, that is, the two edges that are normal to
 the plane of the screen, are always assumed to be symmetry conditions
 for the prebuckling phase of the analysis (but uniform in-plane
 shearing is permitted).

 0 = Prebuckling axisymmetric axial bending is included. Please see
     pp 495-498 in the paper, "Approximate method for the...",
     Computers & Structures, Vol.59, pp 489-527, 1996 for an
     explanation of the axisymmetric prebuckling theory used in PANDA2.

 2 = The prebuckled state is derived from membrane theory. That is,
     both the stringers and rings are smeared out and the presence
     of constraint along the two curved edges and where rings occur
     is ignored. The prebuckled membrane deformation is uniform.

 Cases in which membrane prebuckling theory is used will run quicker
 because there is only one Subcase per load set. However, the fact is
 that conditions are actually different midway between rings from
 those that exist at the rings because of prebuckling axisymmetric
 bending. You may want to optimize first with use of membrane theory,
 then permit bending for further optimization.

 If the panel is curved and there are no rings, use membrane theory.

 Prebuckling: choose 0=bending included; 2=use membrane theory=2
         2
 Buckling: choose 0=simple support or 1=clamping=h

 What is meant here is the boundary conditions for the two
 edges that lie in the plane of the screen and parallel to this
 plane  (the two curved edges if the panel is cylindrical).

 Use simple support if the ends of the panel represent the
 locations of rings, as discussed above. Use simple support
 if the stringers are tapered at the ends of the panel.

 NOTE: If you are using PANDA2 to analyze a ring-stiffened
       cylindrical shell, use simple support (0) here. If you
       have chosen the arc length of the panel in the plane of
       the screen to be equal to pi*radius of the cylinder,
       then the number of half waves over this arc length will
       be equal to the number of full waves in the buckling
       pattern around the entire circumference of a complete
       (360 deg.) cylindrical shell. Thus, the PANDA2 analysis
       of a panel spanning 180 deg. is equivalent to an
       analysis of a complete (360 deg.) cylindrical shell.

 Buckling: choose 0=simple support or 1=clamping=0
         0

Executing setup


  **************   SETUP   ***************

  The purpose of SETUP is to set up an input data file called
  NAME.ALL, in which NAME is your name for this case.  This
  file, NAME.ALL, is a BOSOR4-type of input data file. It is
  used as input for B4READ.

  **********************************************


     GENERATING BOSOR4-TYPE DISCRETIZED MODELS
            FOR A SINGLE PANEL MODULE
 AND FOR THE ENTIRE PANEL WIDTH WITH SMEARED STRINGERS

 The command SETUP causes templates
 of the stiffness and  load-geometric matrices to
 be set up for the buckling problems involving:

   1. a single panel module, which is
      used for:

        a. local buckling and postbuckling
           analysis,
        b. wide column buckling analysis, and
        c. the nonlinear local static response of
           an  axially stiffened panel to uniform
           normal pressure.

   2. the entire panel with smeared stiffeners,
      which is used for:

        a. general instability for a panel with
           an axial load that varies across the
           span of the panel, and

        b. the nonlinear overall static response
           of a stiffened panel to uniform
           normal pressure.

 Much of the BOSOR4 preprocessor software is used
 to do this.  Therefore, in order to use PANDA2
 you must have available to you the most recent
 version of BOSOR4.

Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


 *****************   DECIDE   *******************

 The purpose of DECIDE is to permit you to choose decision
 variables, linked variables, and escape variables for the
 optimization run or runs to follow. The results of the
 interactive session are saved in a file called cylstif.DEC, in
 which cylstif is your name for the case. You may find this file
 useful for future runs of DECIDE in which you want to avoid
 answering many questions interactively. DECIDE also generates
 a file called cylstif.OPD.  cylstif.OPD contains a summary of
 optimization parameters. If you choose the tutorial option,
 cylstif.OPD contains a complete list of the interactive session,
 including prompting questions, all "help" paragraphs, your
 responses to the prompting questions, and evolving lists
 of optimization parameters as they are chosen by you.

 Want to use default for thickness decision variables (type H(elp)?=h

 It is sometimes best to answer Y if you have a lot of different
 layer types. However, it is a bit tricky and YOU MUST BE CAREFUL.
 You answer Y or N.  Your answer means:
  N   means you choose thickness decision variables one-by-one.
  Y   means that for a certain range of layer index types, to be
      specified by you, the following will happen:
     1. the thickness of any layer type for which the winding
        angle is either 0 or 90 deg. will be a decision variable.
     2. the thickness of any layer type will be a decision
        variable, regardless of winding angle, if the winding
        angle of any previous layer type within the given range
        of layer types is not equal to minus the winding angle
        of the current layer type.
     3. If the current winding angle is minus some previous
        winding angle within the given range of layer types,
        the current thickness will be linked to that previous
        thickness, and the linking constant C will be 1.0.
 NOTE: You must choose lowest and highest layer indeces from a
       GIVEN SEGMENT in the module cross section, NOT from the
       entire module, and a skin-stringer module must be done
       separately from a skin-ring module. You MUST answer N
       if winding angles are decision variables.

  11 decision variables have now been identified.
  40 decision variables are permitted.
  29 additional decision variables are allowed.


 Next, choose linked variables.

 A linked variable is a variable that is not a decision
 variable, but is expressed in terms of decision variables,
 thus:

  (linked variable)  =  C1*(decision variable no. j1)
                       +C2*(decision variable no. j2)
                       +C3*(decision variable no. j3)
                       +etc (up to max. of 5 terms)
                       +C0

  in which C1, C2,..;  and C0 are constants.

 For example, material layers with
 + ALPHA degree orientation are usually matched with layers with
 - ALPHA degree orientation. Suppose for a certain layer with
 winding angle + ALPHA, this winding angle is chosen as a
 decision variable.  You want another layer in the same
 laminate to have the winding angle - ALPHA.  Then, for this
 other layer:

  (winding angle) = -1.0*(winding angle of the layer with +ALPHA)

 The winding angle on the left-hand-side of the above
 equation is called a linked variable because its value
 is linked to that of the first mentioned layer. The linking
 constant C1 = -1.0 in this example.

 Any escape variables (Y or N) ?=h

 An escape variable is a variable that when increased
 drives the design toward the feasible region. For example, in
 designs which are buckling-critical, local and general
 instability represent two constraint conditions that bound the
 feasible region. Increasing the thicknesses of any parts while
 keeping all other dimensions the same drives the design toward
 the feasible region (makes buckling less critical). Hence, a
 thickness should always be chosen as an escape variable. Other
 variables, such as winding angles, should  not be used
 as escape variables, since their increase might well result in
 a decrease in the buckling load, hence driving the design toward
 the infeasible region.

 Any escape variables (Y or N) ?=y
 y
 Want to have escape variables chosen by default?=h

 Generally answer Y.  PANDA2 will then automatically choose
 as escape variables all of the thicknesses that are decision
 variables. This is usually the best strategy and use of the
 default option saves you the trouble of doing it interactively.

Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


  *****************   MAINSETUP   ****************
 The purpose of this processor is to permit you to choose loads
 and initial imperfections, Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My, Nxo, Nyo, p,
 T(iseg), Wimp(global), Wimp(local),  (up to 5 sets of them);
 safety factors for general instability, panel instability,
 local instability (panel skin), local instability (stiffener
 parts), and stress; and strategy parameters for subsequent
 batch execution of an optimization analysis (analysis type 1);
 or an analysis of a fixed design at fixed load levels
 (analysis type 2); or an analysis of a fixed design for a
 single load set for monotonically increasing load levels
 (test simulation: analysis type 3).

 Results of the interactive session in MAINSETUP are saved on a

 *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE *** NOTE ***
 Your applied loads should correspond to the ULTIMATE load
 condition (in contrast to LIMIT loads or OPERATING loads).
   *** END NOTE *** END NOTE *** END NOTE *** END NOTE ***

 Next, provide applied resultants, (Nx,Ny,Nxy,Mx,My) and
 (Nx0,Ny0), which are considered to be applied to the panel
 edges. These are stress resultants in units, for example, of
 lb/in for the in-plane loads Nx,Ny,Nxy and (in-lb)/in for the
 moment resultants Mx,My:

    (Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My) constitute part of Load Set A
                          (eigenvalue loads);
    (Nx0, Ny0   ) are part of Load Set B (fixed and uniform
                  loads).

 In the absence of normal pressure, the loads corresponding
 to general instability bifurcation buckling are given by:

    Nx(crit) = Nx0(T) +Nx0 + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nx
    Ny(crit) = Ny0(T) +Ny0 + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Ny
    Nxy(crit) =              eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nxy
    Mx(crit) =               eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Mx
    My(crit) =               eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*My

 in which Nx0(T) and Ny0(T) are the stress resultants from
 curing and temperature loading (considered in this example
 to be part of Load Set B; it is permitted to have them in
 Load Set A, however).

 Also, provide uniform normal pressure, p.  The pressure p
 can be considered either as part of Load Set A or as part
 of Load Set B. If the pressure is part of Load set B, the
 loads corresponding to bifurcation buckling are given by:

  Nx(crit) = Nx0(T)+Nx0+Nx0(p) + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nx
  Ny(crit) = Ny0(T)+Ny0+Ny0(p) + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Ny
  Nxy(crit) =                    eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nxy.
  Mx(crit) =                     eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Mx
  My(crit) =                     eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*My

 in which Nx0(p) and Ny0(p) are stress resultants induced by
 the normal pressure. (considered in this example to be part of
 Load Set B; it is permitted to put the pressure in Load Set A,
 however).

 You are allowed to provide up to 5 sets of loads, imperfections,
 and factors of safety, that is, up to 5 sets of [Nx, Ny, Nxy,
 Mx, My, Nx0, Ny0, p, Wimp(global), Wimp(local), FSGEN, FSPAN,
 FSLOC, FSBSTR, FSSTR and temperature distributions].

 PANDA2 will generate buckling and
 stress or strain constraints corresponding to each of the
 load and imperfection sets that you provide. The resulting design
 will be the best that PANDA2 can find that is subjected during
 its mission to all of the load sets. If the panel is clamped in
 the prebuckling phase, and if there is applied pressure p, then
 those load sets with non-zero p will each have two subcases,
 the first corresponding to conditions at the midlength of the
 panel and the second to conditions at the panel ends. Two subcases
 are also run for cylindrical panels with rings: Subcase 1 corres-
 ponds to conditions midway between adjacent rings and Subcase 2
 corresponds to conditions at the rings.

 For each load set (Nx, Ny, Nxy,....) you will have to provide
 five "factors of safety", FSGEN, FSPAN, FSLOC, FSBSTR and FSSTR.

 FSGEN pertains to general instability (buckling modes which
 include both rings and stringers); FSPAN pertains to panel
 instability (buckling modes for which the rings rotate only
 and for which the stringers deflect; FSLOC pertains to local
 instability between adjacent rings and stringers; FSBSTR
 pertains to local buckling of stringer parts.  FSLOC and
 FSBSTR play  special roles, so read this carefully!  FSSTR is
 the factor of safety for stress.

 FSGEN and FSPAN should always be greater than or equal
 to unity. The purpose of these two factors is to compensate for
 initial imperfections and to prevent general instability or
 panel instability (general buckling between rings).
 The values you assign these factors depend on the geometry and
 loading.  There is a huge literature on the difficult subject
 of "imperfection sensitivity". A recent survey is contained in
 the book, COMPUTERIZED BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF SHELLS by David
 Bushnell, published by Nijhoff and Co., The Netherlands in 1985.
 If you assign a factor of 1.0 to FSGEN and/or FSPAN, the factor
 will automatically be changed by PANDA2 to 1.1 in order to avoid
 the nearly singular behavior that occurs near general or panel
 buckling (abrupt increase in bowing amplitude). This singular
 behavior causes difficulties in convergence of the design
 during optimization iterations.

 Note: During 1993-1994 PANDA2 was upgraded to allow the user
 to supply amplitudes of the following kinds of initial geometric
 imperfections in unstiffened and stiffened cylindrical panels
 and shells:

      1. Out-of-roundness
      2. General buckling modal imperfection (imperfection has
         the shape of the critical general buckling mode).
      3. Inter-ring buckling modal imperfection (imperfection has
         the shape of the critical bay buckling mode from a model
         in which the stringers are smeared out and the panel
         is simply supported at adjacent rings).
      4. Local buckling modal imperfection (imperfection has the
         shape of the critical local skin buckling mode from a model
         in which the local piece of skin is simply supported at
         adjacent stringers and rings).

 If the user supplies reasonable amplitudes for these types of
 imperfections, then he/she may use factors of safety FSGEN and
 FSPAN of unity, provided that the load corresponds to ULTIMATE
 load, not operating load.

 FSLOC plays a special role. If you do not want local buckling
 of the panel skin to occur (you don't want any postbuckling
 capability of the panel skin), then set FSLOC greater than unity,
 as with FSGEN and FSPAN. With IQUICK = 0, if you set FSLOC = 1.0,
 PANDA2 will automatically increase it to 1.1.

 IF YOU WANT SKIN POSTBUCKLING CAPABILITY, BUT YOU DO NOT WANT LOCAL
 BUCKLING TO OCCUR AT LESS THAN A CERTAIN FRACTION OF THE APPLIED
 LOAD, THEN SET  FSLOC  EQUAL TO THAT FRACTION OF THE LOAD.
 IF YOU DON'T CARE AT WHAT LOAD LOCAL BUCKLING OCCURS, SET FSLOC
 EQUAL TO ZERO. PANDA2 WILL THEN ALLOW THE PANEL TO BUCKLE LOCALLY,
 AND IF IQUICK = 0 WILL INCLUDE POST-LOCAL-BUCKLING PHENOMENA IN
 CALCULATIONS OF GENERAL AND PANEL INSTABILITY AND STRESS.

 The comments for FSLOC apply to the buckling factors of safety
 for stringer parts FSBSTR, also. You probably will usually set
 FSBSTR equal to unity.

 IF YOU PLAN TO USE A VALUE OF FSBSTR THAT IS LESS THAN UNITY,
 MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ CAREFULLY ITEMS 37, 60(c), AND 67
 IN PANDA2.NEWS.

 There is no capability to handle local postbuckling of ring parts.
 PANDA2 assigns factors of safety to buckling of ring parts; You
 have no control over them.

 Now, please provide the first Load Set A (Nx, Ny, Nxy)...

 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) normal to the plane of screen, Nx( 1)=h

 What is wanted is the applied line load in the L1 (axial)
 direction in units of force/length. Negative for compression.
 If this axial load varies in the L2 (circumferential) direction,
 use the largest compressive value applied to that edge of the
 panel.

 What is wanted now is the axial load in Load Set A, that is
 the eigenvalue load: the load to be multiplied by the critical
 load factor (the eigenvalue) in computations of the critical
 applied load.

 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) normal to the plane of screen, Nx( 1)=-25000.
  -25000.00
 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) in the plane of the screen,    Ny( 1)=-50000.

 In-plane shear in load set A,                  Nxy( 1)=0.
   0.000000
 Does the axial load vary in the L2 direction?=h

 The L2 direction is in the plane of the screen (circum-
 ferential). If you answer  Y  you will next be asked to
 provide values of Nx at the beginning and end of the panel
 edge which lies in the plane of the screen. PANDA2 assumes
 that Nx varies linearly across this edge and is uniform in
 the direction normal to the plane of the screen.

 NOTE: It may in some cases be beneficial to answer this
       question Y and then provide the same Nx at the beginning
       and end of the axially loaded edge, thus providing
       a uniform axial load. Please see ITEM No.   in PANDA2.NEWS
       and read the "handout" entitled "BUCKLING OF UNSTIFFENED
       PERFECT AND IMPERFECT UNSTIFFENED CYLINDRICAL SHELLS WITH
       PANDA2, dated 25 November, 1988.

 If you answer N the axial load will be uniform over the
 entire panel.

 Want to include effect of transverse shear deformation?=h

 If you answer  Y  reduction factors are computed for various
 kinds of general, semi-general, and local instability and
 crippling. These factors reduce the eigenvalues computed
 from classical "normals-remain-normal" shell theory. The
 reduction factors are based on Timoshenko beam theory. (See
 pp 132-136 of Timoshenko and Goodier, 2nd edition.) That is,
 a typical reduction factor has the form:

        k = 1/[ 1 + n*Nx*Lambda/(t*G13)]

 in which n is a shape factor (1.2 is now used); Nx is the
 local stress resultant (lb/in, for example); Lambda is the
 critical eigenvalue computed from "normals-remain-normal"
 theory; t is the local effective thickness of the wall; and
 G13 is the local effective transverse shear stiffness.

 Want to include effect of transverse shear deformation?=y
 y
 IQUICK = quick analysis indicator (0 or 1)=h

 IQUICK = 0 means discrete BOSOR4-type model will be treated
 IQUICK = 1 means only closed-form types of models will be
            included, except for prediction of the static
            response of the entire panel and of the panel module
            to normal pressure.

 For a panel with stringers almost always use IQUICK = 0
 It may be advisable to start out with IQUICK = 1  and to refine the
 design later with the longer IQUICK = 0 type of analysis. However,
 don't overdo the IQUICK = 1 option: it might easily lead to
 unconservative designs! You must use IQUICK = 0 at least once:
 to check that the design is feasible.  You must use IQUICK = 0
 if you want to include any effects of local buckling of panel
 skin or stringer parts.

 With TRUSS-CORE SANDWICH construction, it is best to use IQUICK = 1
 although IQUICK = 0 is available.

 IQUICK = quick analysis indicator (0 or 1)=0
         0
 Do you want to vary M for minimum local buckling load?=h

 M is the number of axial half-waves between rings
 in the local buckling mode.

 The developer of PANDA2 always answers "Y". Don't
 worry about computer time, as described below. That
 paragraph was written many years ago when computers
 were much slower.

 Computer time can be saved if you are confident that
 the number of axial halfwaves M that you next choose is
 truly the critical value for local skin buckling. Generally
 answer this question Y.  Note, however, that there may
 be cases when you will want to do preliminary optimization
 runs in which M is fixed at a value that you know is near
 the critical value for plates with aspect ratios fairly
 close to that of your current design. In this way you can
 save a lot of computer time and perhaps come up with a
 good preliminary optimum design. You can always later allow
 M to vary, thereby checking your intuition and further
 improving the design.

 Do you want to vary M for minimum local buckling load?=y
 y
 Do you want to choose a starting M for local buckling?=h

 M is the number of axial halfwaves between rings, or if there
 are no rings, along the entire axial length of the panel. If
 you answer N for "no", PANDA2 starts with M calculated
 from the formula:

  M = SQRT(C(5,5)/C(4,4))*(axial length of panel between rings)/
      (stringer spacing - stringer base width) + 2

 which is based on experimental observations that local buckles
 of uniformly axially compressed long, narrow, isotropic
 plates are almost square.

 However, from previous experience on this and other similar
 cases, you may wish to use a different starting value for M.
 Generally answer this question N for "no".

 Do you want to choose a starting M for local buckling?=n
 n
 Do you want to perform a "low-axial-wavenumber" search?=h

 What is being referred to here is a search over the number
 of axial halfwaves between rings to determine the critical
 local buckling load factor.  There are many panels and
 loadings for which the local buckling load factor versus the number
 of axial halfwaves has more than one minimum. If you answer
 Y, PANDA2 will search for critical local buckling load factors
 over two ranges of axial halfwaves, a high range and a low range.

 The developer of PANDA2 always answers "Y" . Don't worry about
 computer time. The next paragraph was written when computers
 were much slower.

 Generally, in order to ensure reliability, you should answer
 this question Y. However, as you gain more experience with
 PANDA2, you may occasionally want to answer N, since quite
 a bit of computer time can be saved by doing so, especially
 if you are doing optimization.  You can always do preliminary
 optimization in which you answer N (no low-wavenumber search),
 followed by more refined (and more costly) optimization runs
 in which you answer Y.

 Factor of safety for general instability, FSGEN( 1)=h

 You can use FSGEN = 1.0 if your applied load set corresponds
 to the ULTIMATE load condition (in constrast to LIMIT load or
 OPERATING load), and if you specify reasonable ampltiudes for
 initial imperfections, Wimpg, Wimpg1, Wimpg2, Wpan, Wloc.

 If you do NOT specify amplitudes for Wimpg, etc, and/or if
 the applied load is less than that corresponding to the ULTIMATE
 condition, then the factor of safety FSGEN should account for
 unknown initial imperfections and/or insufficient applied load,
 as well as for the approximate manner in which the general
 buckling load factor is calculated in PANDA2.  Panels that buckle
 locally at loads far below the design load are not particularly
 sensitive to initial imperfections. For such panels, use
               1.1  <   FSGEN    <  2.0
 Panels designed so that local and general instability loads are
 nearly equal are somewhat sensitive to initial imperfections,
 and FSGEN should be about 1.4 even if the panel is flat.
 Axially stiffened cylinders under axial compression should
 usually have  FSGEN = 2.
 Axially compressed monocoque cylinders under axial compression
 should have FSGEN = 4  if r/t > 300; FSGEN = 2 if r/t < 100.
 Cylinders under uniform external pressure should have FSGEN = 1.4.
 Cylinders under uniform torsion (in-plane shear) should have
 FSGEN = 1.3.
 NOTE: The above are general guidelines only. For more details,
 consult the extensive NASA literature, ASME Code Case N-284,
 and run PANDA with the option to get interaction curves for
 imperfect shells. Also see COMPUTERIZED BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF
 SHELLS by David Bushnell, Nijhoff and Co., The Netherlands, 1985

 The best way to design panels with PANDA2 is to use ULTIMATE loads
 and to specify reasonable (conservative) amplitudes for the various
 components, Wimpg, Wimpg1, Wimpg2, Wpan, Wloc, of imperfections,
 then use FSGEN = 1.0.  When you have an optimum design check its
 performance by using STAGS.

 Occasionally, you may want to use FSGEN = 0.999 . You do this
 in order to prevent PANDA2 from automatically increasing FSGEN
 to 1.1, which it does if FSGEN = 1.0. For example, you might wamt
 to use FSGEN = 0.999 in a case for which you intend to compare
 results from PANDA2 with results from some other analysis.

 Factor of safety for panel (between rings) instability, FSPAN( 1)=h

 This factor pertains to buckling between rings but with circum-
 ferential wavelengths that are long enough to cause buckling
 of at least one stringer.

 This factor should account for unknown initial imperfections
 and the approximate manner in which the general instability
 load factor is calculated in PANDA2.  Panels that buckle
 locally at loads far below the design load are not particularly
 sensitive to initial imperfections. For such panels, use
               1.1  <   FSPAN    <  1.4
 Panels designed so that local and general instability loads are
 nearly equal are somewhat sensitive to initial imperfections,
 and FSPAN should be about 1.4 even if the panel is flat.
 Axially stiffened cylinders under axial compression should
 usually have  FSPAN = 2 (except read on about wide column model).
 Axially compressed monocoque cylinders under axial compression
 should have FSPAN = 4  if r/t > 300; FSPAN = 2 if r/t < 100.
 Cylinders under uniform external pressure should have FSPAN = 1.4.
 Cylinders under uniform torsion (in-plane shear) should have
 FSPAN = 1.3.
 If you plan to use the wide column model, you can use a smaller
 factor of safety here than would otherwise be the case. In fact,
 you can probably get away with using a factor FSPAN = 1.0.

 Minimum load factor for local buckling (Type H for HELP), FSLOC( 1)=h

 Local buckling here means buckling of the panel skin between
 adjacent stringers and rings. The factor FSLOC is NOT included
 in load factors for local buckling of stringer parts. A
 different factor, FSBSTR, governs local buckling of stringer
 parts. Factors of safety for local buckling of ring parts
 are assigned by PANDA2; you have no control over them.

 FSLOC plays a special role. If you do NOT want local buckling
 to occur (you don't want any postbuckling capability), then set
 FSLOC greater than unity (minimum of 1.1), as with FSGEN and FSPAN.
 With the IQUICK = 0 option, PANDA2 assumes the panel between
 adjacent stringers is flat, so that FSLOC = 1.1 can be used.

 If you want postbuckling capability, but you do not want local
 buckling to occur at less than a certain fraction of the applied
 load, then set FSLOC equal to that fraction of the load. For
 example, suppose the load set Nx, Ny, Nxy corresponds to an
 ultimate load that is 1.5 times the design load. You may not
 want local buckling to occur below a limit load that is 1.25
 times the design load. To enforce this constraint, set
 FSLOC = 1.25/1.50 = 0.8333. If you are not bothered by local
 buckling at all, set FSLOC equal to zero.

 Occasionally, you may want to use FSLOC = 0.999 . You do this
 in order to prevent PANDA2 from automatically increasing FSLOC
 to 1.1, which it does if FSLOC = 1.0. For example, you might wamt
 to use FSLOC = 0.999 in a case for which you intend to compare
 results from PANDA2 with results from some other analysis.

 FACTOR OF SAFETY FOR LOCAL   INSTABILITY, FSLOC(1),
 HAS BEEN CHANGED TO FSLOC = 1.1 TO AVOID SINGULARITY

 You will next be asked to provide a minimum load factor, FSBSTR,
 for local buckling of the stringer parts. You should probably
 use a factor of unity.

 If you use a factor less than unity, PANDA2 may produce a
 design in which one or more of the stringer parts buckle
 locally at a load smaller than the applied load. Thus,
 local buckling of the stringer parts would be allowed in
 your design concept. USE WITH CAUTION!!!

 IF YOU PLAN TO USE A VALUE OF FSBSTR THAT IS LESS THAN UNITY,
 MAKE SURE THAT YOU FIRST READ CAREFULLY ITEMS 37, 60(c), AND 67
 IN PANDA2.NEWS.

 Also, read items 19 and 30 of PANDA2.NEWS. If the stiffeners
 are J or T cross sections, a factor of 1.4 is
 applied to the buckling load factor for buckling of both
 segments 3 and 4 of the stiffener together. The factor you next
 apply is in addition to this, so that the total factor is:
 F.S. = 1.4*FSBSTR.

 Minimum load factor for stiffener buckling (Type H), FSBSTR( 1)=h

 Stiffener buckling here means local buckling of the parts of
 the stiffener, with the "corners" between stiffener parts
 rotating but not displacing.

 IF YOU PLAN TO USE A VALUE OF FSBSTR THAT IS LESS THAN UNITY,
 MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ CAREFULLY ITEMS 37, 60(c) AND 67
 IN PANDA2.NEWS.

 FSBSTR plays a special role. If you do NOT want local buckling
 to occur (you don't want any postbuckling capability of the
 stiffener parts), then set FSBSTR greater than unity. (Minimum
 value of 1.1 is suggested.)

 The factor of safety for buckling of ring parts is always 1.0
 or greater. If you set FSBSTR to a value less than 1.0, your
 value will be used for buckling of stringer parts, but 1.0 will
 be used for buckling of ring parts.

 If you want postbuckling capability, but you do not want local
 buckling of the stringer parts to occur at less than a certain
 fraction of the applied load, then set FSBSTR equal to that
 fraction of the load. For  example, suppose the load set
 Nx, Ny, Nxy corresponds to an ultimate load that is 1.5 times
 the design load. You may not want local buckling to occur below
 a limit load that is 1.25 times the design load. To enforce this
 constraint, set FSBSTR = 1.25/1.50 = 0.8333. If you are not
 bothered by local buckling of the stringer parts at all, set
 FSBSTR equal to zero.

 to calculate stress, expecially if local buckling of the skin

 criterion is also approximate. Use

 Do you want "flat skin" discretized module for local buckling?=h

 This question refers to the discretized skin-stringer single
 module model (see for example, Fig. 20(b), p. 524 of the original
 long PANDA2 paper, PANDA2 - program for minimum weight design...
 Computers and Structures, vol 25, 469-605, 1987) for local
 buckling of the panel skin between rings. This discretized
 module model is used for local buckling if the user-selected
 analysis control integer, IQUICK = 0  .

 Generally, you should answer 'Y', as this will lead to
 conservative designs. However, there may be times when neglecting
 the curvature of an axially stiffened cylindrical panel during
 computations of local buckling of the skin-stringer module leads
 to results that are too conservative. This would happen, for
 example, if the stringers were spaced at intervals that are not
 very small compared to the shell radius.

 The default answer is "Y". A "Y" answer generates IICURV = 0 and
 a "N" answer generates IICURV = 1, in which IICURV is the control
 index used in PANDA2. (IICURV=0 means "no curvature", 1 means
 "yes curvature".)

 It would be a good idea to optimize panels with this choice
 taken first one way then the other way.

 Please see panda2/news Item No. 530 for more information.

 Do you want "flat skin" discretized module for local buckling?=n
 n
 Do you want to skip the KOITER local postbuckling analysis?=h

 You answered the previous question "N". Therefore, the index
 IICURV = 1 and your PANDA2 discretized single skin-stringer
 module model retains the curvature of the cylindrical panel
 skin. However, the local postbuckling KOITER theory used in
 PANDA2 is still based on the assumption that the skin is flat,
 that is, the stringers are close enough together so that it may
 not be too conservative to ignore the curvature of the
 cylindrical panel. The local postbuckling state is entered
 sooner for a skin-stringer panel module with a flat skin than
 for one with a curved skin. Therefore, the stresses computed
 from the approximate post-local buckling analysis in PANDA2 will
 be higher than those of the actual curved panel, provided that
 the local buckling load factor for the curved panel is greater
 than unity at the design load (no postbuckling occurs for the
 curved panel).

 If you think that the "flat skin" postbuckling model is too
 conservative, then answer "Y" to the current prompt. Then
 PANDA2 will skip the KOITER local postbuckling analysis and
 compute the stresses as if the amplitude of the local post
 buckling deformation is zero.

 The default answer is "N". A "N" answer generates IIKOIT = 1 and
 a "Y" answer generates IIKOIT = 0, in which IIKOIT is the control
 index used in PANDA2. (IIKOIT=0 means "don't perform postbuckling
 computations", 1 means "yes, perform postbuckling computations".)

 It would be a good idea to optimize panels with this choice
 taken first one way then the other way.

 ******* NOTE ********
 If you are planning to do a ITYPE=3 analysis, you MUST
 choose a "N" answer here. [ITYPE=3 = fixed design under
 increasing load (test simulation)].
 ***** END NOTE ******

 Do you want to skip the KOITER local postbuckling analysis?=y

 Do you want wide-column buckling to constrain the design?=h

 The wide-column model refers to the portion of the panel
 between adjacent rings. If there are no rings the wide-column
 model refers to the entire panel.

 If the portion of the panel between rings is unstiffened or
 truss-core sandwich, or isogrid you should always answer N.
 For these configurations the wide column model is too conservative.

 Otherwise:
 If the inter-ring portion is flat you should probably answer Y.
 If the panel is cylindrical (curvature in the plane of the
 screen) the wide-column buckling load may be too conservative,
 leading to unnecessarily heavy designs. If, for a curved panel,
 you answer Y, then you will not have to worry as much
 about the effect of initial imperfections as you would if you
 answer N, because the wide-column buckling load is not
 sensitive to initial geomtrical imperfections if there is
 little or no interaction between local and general buckling.
 This is a difficult and not very well understood area in the
 field of shell buckling. Actually, I recommend that you design
 a panel first with use of the wide-column model of general
 instability and then without this model.  In any case, check
 your general instability load when you finish optimizing by
 running PANEL, which sets up a discretized model of the entire
 panel width with stringers treated as shell branches. If this
 PANEL model has a load factor corresponding to general instability
 less than unity, you need either to include the wide-column
 model as a constraint or increase the factor of safety.

 Next, please provide the fixed stress resultants, Nx0 and Ny0.
 These constitute part of the in-plane loads in Load Set B.
 Note that no fixed in-plane shear resultant, Nxy0, is permitted.
 The fixed stress resultants, Nx0 and Ny0, are not multiplied by
 the eigenvalue (eigenvalue = load factor determined in
 bifurcation buckling analyses). In the absence of normal pressure,
 the critical load can be calculated from:

     Nx(crit) = Nx0(T) +Nx0 + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nx
     Ny(crit) = Ny0(T) +Ny0 + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Ny
    Nxy(crit) =               eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nxy

 in which Nx0(T) and Ny0(T) are resultants generated by curing
 and/or temperature (loading) variation from segment to segment
 (considered in the above equations to be part of Load Set B;
 the thermal loading can be part of Load Set A, however).
 Note that the fixed loads are added to any stress resultants
 that are generated by thermal loading of a composite panel. The
 loads that you are now asked to provide are fixed applied loads.

 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) normal to the plane of screen, Nx0( 1)=0

 Axial load applied along the (0=neutral plane), (1=panel skin)=h

 Choose 0 or 1.

 0   means that the axial load is applied at the neutral surface,
     that is, the axial load causes no axial bending of a panel
     with axial stiffeners. The writer almost always uses this
     choice.

 1   means that the axial load is applied along the middle
     surface of the panel skin.  A simply supported panel
     with axial stiffeners will bend when loaded in this way.
     PANDA2 includes this axial bending (bowing) effect.

 Please use 0 if the panel is clamped. Generally, use 0

 Axial load applied along the (0=neutral plane), (1=panel skin)=0
         0
 Uniform applied pressure [positive upward. See H(elp)], p( 1)=h

 NOTE: This pressure is assumed UNIFORM over entire panel.
 Positive pressure always pushes upward.  (Please refer to the
 sketches of the panel module for physical picture of what "upward"
 means.)  See Fig. 8, p. 490 of Computers and Structures, Vol. 25,
 1987. If there are no stringers or if you specified that
 the stringers are external, and  if the panel is curved,
 then positive (upward) pressure pushes on the concave surface
 of the panel (is internal). If you specified that the stringers
 are internal and if the panel is curved, then positive (upward)
 pressure pushes on the convex surface of the panel. Figure
 8 of the PANDA2 paper shows the sign convention for pressure
 and curvature.

 NOTE: If the panel is curved the value of p must be consistent
       with the value of hoop resultant that you supplied
       earlier (for cylindrical panels Ny=p*r).

 Load Set A is the "eigenvalue" load set, that is:

   Critical load = (Load Set B) + eigenvalue*(Load Set A)

 If you are concerned with a cylindrical panel or shell and the
 pressure is internal (causes tensile membrane loads), then you
 should probably put the pressure in Load Set B. If the pressure
 is external (causes destabilizing membrane loads), then you
 should probably put the pressure in Load Set A.

 pressure part of Load Set A.

 Choose in-plane immovable (IFREE=0) or movable (IFREE=1) b.c.( 1)=h

 The static response to normal pressure may be strongly dependent
 on whether the edges of the panel are allowed to move in the
 horizontal direction (in-plane for flat panel), normal to each edge.
 IFREE=0 means that this horizontal motion is not allowed. (immovable)
 IFREE=1 means that this horizontal motion is allowed.     (  movable)

 Generally, you will get larger normal deflections (more bowing)
 due to pressure if the edges are movable (IFREE=1). The
 membrane strains will be lower and the bending strains will
 be higher with movable edges than with immovable edges.

 Note that the analysis with IFREE=0 is more rigorous than with
 IFREE = 1: With IFREE=0 Newton iterations converge to a nonlinear
 solution. The assumed displacements, u,v,w appear as Eqs. (9.5)
 in the long PANDA2 paper (Computers and Structures,pp469-605,1987).
 With IFREE=1 the same displacement functions are used, but only
 the linear theory is used, and the in-plane resultants Nx(p), Ny(p)
 are assumed to be zero for a flat panel. (For a curved panel,
 Nx(p) is zero and Ny(p) is calculated from the condition that
 no horizontal force develops along the straight edges).

 Please note that if IFREE = 1, movable edges are permitted only
 in the global model of the entire panel under uniform normal
 pressure unless you specify otherwise. The IFREE=0 condition is
 applied in the local model (single module model) unless you
 specify otherwise in the following prompt.

 If IFREE = 1, any overall axial resultant that develops from
 pressure being applied to the local model is automatically
 cancelled by PANDA2's application of an equal and opposite
 axial resultant, thus maintaining the condition that no
 axial load develops if the edges are free to approach eachother
 as the pressure is applied.

 If you are in doubt, please just hit "ENTER". Then PANDA2
 will supply the default value, which is unity.

 Are you feeling well today (type H)?=h

 This question used to read:
    Local model: Are the edges in-plane movable? [See (H)elp]
 See ITEM 156 of PANDA2.NEWS for the reason it was modified. A
 silly question was added so that people with old cases already
 set up would not run into problems upon re-running these cases.

 This was the old "help" paragraph corresponding to the original
 question:
 Answer Y or N. If you answer Y the response of the local
 (single-module) model to uniform normal pressure is calculated
 from a nonlinear theory in which the two edges normal to the
 screen located at the symmetry planes midway between stringers
 are allowed to approach eachother as the panel skin deforms
 locally under the uniform normal pressure (no in-plane hoop
 load develops in the panel skin as it deforms under the pressure).
 Generally designs obtained with in-plane movable edges are more
 conservative than those obtained with in-plane fixed edges because:

 (a) the maximum stresses are higher with in-plane movable
     edges because there is more bending in this case;

 (b) No in-plane tension develops in the panel skin with in-
     plane movable edges which means that local buckling
     load factors will be lower in this case.

 Is there a maximum allowable deflection due to pressure?=h

 Answer Y or N.  If your answer is Y, then you will be asked
 to provide the maximum deflection allowed. A constraint
 condition will be introduced into the design process. This
 constraint condition has the form:

             WPGMAX/(WPG*AMPLIT) > 1

 in which WPGMAX is the maximum allowable deflection, WPG is
 the normal deflection at the midlength of the panel due to
 pressure without any effect of in-plane applied loads, and
 AMPLIT is an amplitude factor that accounts for the softening
 effect of the in-plane loads. WPG means "normal deflection
 W due to pressure P from a Global (smeared stiffener) model."

 modes of initial geometric imperfections
               (Wimpg1, Wimpg2, Wpan, Wloc):

 (a) overall out-of-roundness amplitude, Wimpg1, where
         Wimpg1 = (Max. diameter - Min. diameter)/4.

      NOTE: Use zero if the panel is flat. (Wimpg1 will be reset
            to zero if PANDA2 detects that the panel is flat).

      NOTE: If the panel is curved:
      Whatever circumferential angle the panel spans,
      pretend for the purpose of this input datum that it
      represents part of a complete (360 deg.) cylindrical
      shell that has an out-of-roundness with amplitude Wimpg1.
      If Wimpg2 (see next paragraph) is zero, the sign of
      Wimpg1 is significant. Otherwise, Wimpg1 will have the
      same sign as Wimpg2 in the calculations in PANDA2.

 (b) overall buckling modal imperfection amplitude, Wimpg2.
      NOTE: If the panel is stiffened, the sign of the
      overall buckling modal imperfection Wimpg2 is important
      because it affects how the panel skin and stiffener
      cross sections of the imperfect panel become loaded
      under the applied loads. Type H(elp) for a discussion
      of this when you are prompted for Wimpg2.

 (c) if there are rings, inter-ring buckling modal imperfection
      amplitude, Wpan.  NOTE: The sign of Wpan is important for
      the same reason given in Paragraph (b).

 (d) local buckling modal imperfection amplitude, Wloc.
      The sign of Wloc is NOT significant.

 Out-of-roundness, Wimpg1=(Max.diameter-Min.diam)/4, Wimpg1( 1)=0.
   0.000000
 Initial buckling modal general imperfection amplitude, Wimpg2( 1)=h

 In PANDA2 the general imperfection is assumed to have the same
 shape as the general buckling mode obtained from a PANDA-type
 (closed form) analysis of the cylindrical panel.

 IMPORTANT NOTES:
 If the panel has axial stiffeners (stringers) and no rings and
 if the analysis model IQUICK = 0, then:
   You should consider optimizing with both negative and positive
   Wimpg2. Under axial loading, negative Wimpg2 gives rise to
   more compression in the skin than in the tips of the stringers.
   The opposite is true for positive Wimpg2. You can optimize for
   both positive and negative Wimpg2 by introduction of two load
   cases in MAINSETUP with everything the same in each except the
   sign of Wimpg2.
 With IQUICK=1, optimization with both positive and negative
 Wimpg2 is automatically performed within a single load case.

 If the panel is clamped for buckling, has stringers, and is flat
 the effective simply supported length may be less than the actual
 length: L(eff) = LENMOD*L, where LENMOD is computed by PANDA2. In
 this case, the Wimpg2 that you provide should be given by:
       Wimpg2(your input) = Wimpg2(actual)*2*LENMOD**2
 You can obtain LENMOD by running PANDAOPT with ITYPE=2, NPRINT=2
 and search the resulting *.OPM file for the string: LENMOD

   0.000000
 Do you want PANDA2 to change imperfection amplitudes (see H(elp))?( 1)=h

 Default is "Y". If you answer "Y" then PANDA2 may automatically
 reduce the amplitude of one or more of the buckling modal
 imperfections that it judges to be larger than that which would
 be easily detectable by the most casual inspection and therefore
 greater than that represented by a reasonable tolerance. It was
 necessary to allow PANDA2 to do this in order:

 (a) to try to avoid extreme oscillations of design margins from
 design iteration to iteration, and

 (b) to avoid production of optimum designs that are too
 conservative.

 Since the initial buckling modal imperfections have the unknown
 shapes of the local, inter-ring, and general buckling modes,
 the user cannot know ahead of time whether or not a given
 imperfection amplitude is too large. An imperfection of given
 amplitude is easier to detect if it has a shape that has short
 axial and circumferential wavelengths than if it has long
 wavelengths because it is the wall out-of-plane rotations that
 are most likely to be detected. These out-of-plane rotations
 increase inversely with the critical buckling modal wavelengths.
 The user does not know in advance what the various wavelengths
 of the critical buckling modes are.

 An answer "N" means STRATEGY (1) in [17] is followed.
 An answer "Y" means STRATEGY (2) in [17] is followed.

 If you answer "Y", PANDA2 will take the following three steps:

 Step 1. Use the critical buckling mode shape,
   (m,n,slope)=(axial halfwaves, circ. halfwaves, nodal line slope)
   corresponding to the PERFECT rather than the IMPERFECT geometry
   if the axial halfwavelength of the critical buckling mode of the
   IMPERFECT geometry is less than or equal to half the user-
   specified axial halfwavelength of the imperfection.

 Step 2. Change the amplitude of whatever imperfection results
   from Step 1 by the factor (ratio):
   (axial halfwavelength of the critical buckling mode)/
   (user-specified axial halfwavelength of the imperfection)

 Step 3. Reduce the buckling modal imperfection amplitude remaining
   after Steps 1 and 2 if it leads to an out-of-plane wall rotation
   that is greater than 0.1 radian. If this happens a warning such as
   the following (which happens to apply only to the local buckling
   modal imperfection) will be printed in the *.OPM file:

  ******** WARNING ******** WARNING ******** WARNING *********
  THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL HALFWAVELENGTH OF THE LOCAL IMPERFECTION
  Wimp(local), WHICH HAS THE SAME FORM AS THE LOCAL BUCKLING
  MODE, IS SHORT, WHILE ITS AMPLITUDE IS RATHER HIGH:
  Circumferential halfwavelength of Wimp(local),   Wlength=2.97E+01
  Present amplitude of the local imperfection, Wimp(local)=1.67E+00
  PLEASE CONSIDER REDUCING Wimp(local). YOUR DESIGN MAY BE TOO
  CONSERVATIVE.
  ************* END WARNING *********** END WARNING **********

 The following material printed in the *.OPM file informs the user
 by what factor the user-supplied imperfection amplitude was reduced
 in this case in order to keep the maximum out-of-plane wall rotation
 less than 0.1 rad:

  LOCAL AND GLOBAL IMPERFECTION AMPLITUDES,
  AMPLITUDE MODIFIERS THAT KEEP MAX. WALL ROTATION GENERATED
  BY THE MODAL IMPERFECTION COMPONENT LESS THAT 0.1 RADIAN,
  AND AMPLIFICATION FACTORS TO ACCOUNT FOR GROWTH OF THE
  INITIAL IMPERFECTIONS DURING LOADING:
                      USER-PROVIDED   AMPLITUDE   AMPLIFICATION
                      IMPERFECTION    MODIFIER    FACTOR WYYAMP

  local imperfection    1.6750E+00    5.4998E-01    1.0182E+00

 In the above case the local buckling modal imperfection amplitude
 actually used by PANDA2 is 1.675 x 0.54998 = 0.92122.

 You may, however, want to answer the question "N". For example,
 if you wish to use PANDA2 to evaluate a damaged panel with a
 known (probably rather large) initial imperfection, you will not
 want PANDA2 to "take charge" and automatically modify the
 imperfection amplitude as it did in the above example.

 Do you want PANDA2 to change imperfection amplitudes (see H(elp))?( 1)= y
 y

 PANDA2 will next ask you to provide an axial halfwavelength of
 the general buckling modal imperfection. For axially stiffened
 panels or panels under external pressure or flat panels, please
 use the axial length of the panel. PANDA2 uses the axial half-
 wavelength you give here to change your given amplitude of the general
 buckling modal imperfection if the axial halfwavelength of the
 general buckling mode of the perfect shell turns out to be
 different from that you will next provide here (imperfection amplitude
 becomes smaller if the axial halfwavelength of the critical buckling
 mode of the perfect shell is shorter than that you provide here and
 larger if it is longer than that you will provide here). The purpose
 of this strategy is to prevent wild swings in margins corresponding
 to small changes in design caused by abruptly different critical
 general buckling mode shapes. Please see [17] and ITEM NO. 525
 of ...panda2/doc/panda2.news for more details.

 Axial halfwavelength of typical general buckling mode, AXLWAV( 1)=300.
   300.0000
 Do you want PANDA2 to find the general imperfection shape?( 1)=h

 Almost always answer Y (yes). PANDA2 will then find the
 (m,n,slope) for the general buckling mode, in which
 m = number of axial halfwaves
 n = number of circumferential halfwaves
 s = slope of the buckling nodal lines.
 The imperfection shape is assumed to be the same as
 the general buckling mode shape.

 If you for some reason should answer N (no), then you
 must next supply values of (m,n), called MUSER and NUSER.
 In the section of PANDA2 that computes general buckling
 imperfection sensitivity, PANDA2 will not search over
 (m,n) space to find the critical general buckling modal
 imperfection shape, but instead will use only the values
 (MUSER,NUSER) that you will next supply. PANDA2 will
 continue to search over "s-space" (s = slope of buckling nodal
 lines) for a minimum general buckling load factor with
 respect to s for given and fixed (m,n) = (MUSER, NUSER).

 IF THE LOCAL IMPERFECTION IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL
 TO ZERO, IT WILL BE SET EQUAL TO (1/10)TH OF THE THICKNESS
 OF THE SKIN MIDWAY BETWEEN STRINGERS. THIS IS DONE TO MAKE
 THE VARIATION OF STIFFNESS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE LOCAL
 BUCKLING LOAD SMOOTHER, WHICH RESULTS IN BETTER BEHAVIOR
 DURING OPTIMIZATION CYCLES.

 Maximum allowable average axial strain (type H for HELP)( 1)=h


 This input permits you to account for strain (stress)
 concentrations near bolt holes. Use a value such that if
 this value were reached along axial lines of fasteners,
 there would be no failure because of the fasteners. This
 allowable is placed in the load loop because you may want
 to provide different values for tension and compression.

 A factor of safety of unity is used in PANDA2 for this
 allowable. Also, the margin is calculated using only the
 axial strain component, EXAVE.  The concept of effective strain
 resulting from the three in-plane strain components, EXAVE,
 EYAVE and EXYAVE, is not used.  Therefore, you must set the
 maximum allowable average axial strain small enough to yield
 a reliable design.

 If you are not concerned with this, just type zero or a
 large number. Use a positive number. Units are strain, not percent.

 Maximum allowable average axial strain (type H for HELP)( 1)=1.

 Is there any thermal "loading" in this load set (Y/N)?=h

 What is meant is thermal loading other than curing.
 Usually, you answer N.  If there is aerodynamic heating or
 other source of heating which may be significant in your case,
 answer Y. If you answer Y, you will be asked to provide two
 temperatures for the panel skin (corresponding to the uppermost
 and lowermost surfaces of the panel skin and stringer/ring bases)
 and one temperature each for the outstanding stringer flange
 and outstanding ring flange. (With blade stiffening, you will
 be asked to provide the temperature at the blade tip). The
 temperatures you will provide are assumed to be uniform over
 each segment of the panel module except as follows:

  1. the panel skin and stringer and ring bases, in which the
     temperature is assumed to vary linearly through the thickness,
     except in the case of truss-core for which the temperature
     in the panel skin is constant through the thicknesses of each
     of the two face sheets (different in the two sheets, though).

  2. the stiffener webs, in which the temperature is assumed to
     vary linearly from the web root to the web tip. At the web
     root the web temperature is the same as that of the panel skin
     at that point. At the web tip the web temperature is assumed
     to be the same as that of the outstanding flange.

 Is there any thermal "loading" in this load set (Y/N)?=n
 n

 Next, you will be asked, "Do you want a complete analysis?"
 Usually you should respond Y (or just hit "ENTER"). This question
 refers to analysis with stress and buckling constraints generated
 from both Subcase 1 (midlength or midbay) and Subcase 2 (panel ends
 or at rings).  (Note that for some loadings the "complete" analysis
 has only a single subcase, Subcase 1. Then your response to this
 question, although required, will not matter). Ordinarily you will
 want the panel to be optimized accounting both for the behavior at
 its midlength (midbay) and at its ends (at rings). However, there
 are doubtless cases for which this conservative approach may
 generate overly heavy panels. For example, there may exist rather
 local stress concentrations in the panel skin and local buckling
 of the panel skin only in the neighborhoods of rings in a curved
 panel or at the ends of a clamped curved or flat panel with applied
 pressure. The use of a "complete" analysis might then cause the
 panel skin to be overly thick over most of the panel length in order
 that it not buckle due to local compressive resultants present only
 near rings (or at ends). The best design might well be a panel the
 skin of which is thinner midway between rings than near rings. The
 skin near rings would be thickened locally to reduce stress and
 prevent local buckling there. Since PANDA2 does not handle axially
 varying thickness or stringer cross section directly, you might want
 to perform two sequential optimizations, the first in which you do
 the "complete" analysis in order to ensure that the worst conditions
 generated by both Subcases 1 and 2 are included, and the second in
 which only the conditions for Subcase 1 constrain the design. Before
 doing the second optimization, you might have to rerun DECIDE in
 order to eliminate the stringer and ring spacings and perhaps the
 stringer cross section dimensions as decision variables, and to reset
 lower bounds on stringer and ring thicknesses and perhaps web heights
 and flange widths to the values obtained from the first optimization.
 This you might need to do to ensure that the final design can be
 fabricated and that it will survive the conditions at Subcase 2,
 which is not checked during the second optimization. Both the first
 optimum design (from the "complete" analysis) and the second optimum
 design (from the "Subcase 1 only" analysis) you would incorporate
 into the actual panel during manufacture: the panel skin and stringer
 dimensions from the first optimum design would be used for a certain
 axial length of panel near the rings, and the panel skin and stringer
 dimensions and ring dimensions from the second optimum design would
 be used for the panel midlength (or midbay) region and for the rings.
 You would have to specify the axial extent of each of the two regions.
 Unfortunately, PANDA2 cannot do this for you. You will have to rely
 on engineering judgment. If you use PANDA2 this way to generate
 designs that are really beyond the straightforward scope of PANDA2,
 it is especially important for you to apply some general-purpose
 finite element code such as STAGS to verify the feasiblility of your
 fancy hybrid optimum design before you actually fabricate the panel.

 Use reduced effective stiffness in panel skin (H(elp), Y or N)?=h

 Generally answer Y in order to avoid unconservative designs.
 However, occasionally you may want to answer N in order to avoid
 too much conservativeness for cases for which you believe the
 panel skin is fully effective for overall bending of the panel.

 You should answer Y if you panel has any local initial
 imperfection.

 If the panel skin is permitted to buckle locally, that is,
 if the factor of safety for local buckling, FSLOC, is
 significantly less than unity (e.g. FSLOC < 0.9) then you
 should always answer Y.

 A "N" answer may be suitable for panels in which the stringer
 spacing  b  is about the same as the stringer height  h  or
 width  w, such as may be the case for hat-stiffened panels
 with closely pitched corrugated skin or for truss-core panels,
 provided that local buckling of the panel skin is not permitted
 to occur.

 If you answer Y to this question, reduced membrane stiffnesses
 C11, C12, C22, and C33 are used for the panel skin segments
 for calculation of overall bending of the panel under uniform
 pressure and for predictions of general instability load factors
 that are used for determination of amplification of axial bowing.

 NPRINT= output index (-1=min. 0=good, 1=ok, 2=more, 3=too much)=h

 Usually use 0 . NPRINT = 0 is recommended for optimization
 analyses, since these analyses produce another useful file,
 NAME.OPP, which contains the entire design history and is much
 easier to read than the NAME.OPM file. The new plotting capability
 CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT, also makes it less necessary to generate
 lots of printed output. NPRINT = 3 really gets alot of output.
 NPRINT = 2 yields the C(i,j), the force distributions
 in the various parts of the panel module,
 local buckling modal displacements, and resdistributed loads due
 to bowing and local postbuckling behavior. Do not use 2 if you
 are doing an optimization analysis.  When you use 0, please
 make sure to consult the NAME.OPP file (optimization, ITYPE= 1),
 or the NAME.OPI file (test simulation, ITYPE = 3), for more
 information. NPRINT = -1 leads to minimal output (margins and
 design only.

 The developer of PANDA2 generally uses NPRINT = 0 for
 optimization runs (ITYPE=1) and NPRINT = 2 for the analysis of
 a fixed design (ITYPE = 2). NPRINT = 2 generates a large *.OPM
 file, but you can find what you want by searching for the
 strings, "CHAPTER" or "MARGINS" or "WEIGHT".

 On rare occasions you may want to use NPRINT = 2 with ITYPE = 1 .
 When you do this PANDA2 prints out details pertaining to each
 CHAPTER, both for the current design and for the perturbed
 designs, then prints out the matrix of contraint gradients, then
 is that PANDA2 computes the constraint gradient matrix and then
 aborts. You may want to set NPRINT = 2 with ITYPE = 1 in a case
 for which you suspect that there is a bug in the program or
 perhaps in your input data. You can inspect the constraint
 gradient matrix to see if there are any very large gradients that
 might have been generated because of a bug. Then you will want
 to inspect the results for the current and for the perturbed
 designs in an attempt to determine the cause or causes of the
 overly large constraint gradients.

 NPRINT= output index (-1=min. 0=good, 1=ok, 2=more, 3=too much)=0
         0

 Next, you will be asked to provide an index, ISAND, for the type
 of shell theory to be used in the PANDA-type (closed form)
 buckling analysis. You can choose either ISAND = 0 or ISAND = 1
 or ISAND = 2:
 ISAND = 0 means that Donnell theory will be used (corrected for
            "live" pressure that effects primarily n = 2 and n = 3
            buckling load factors of cylindrical shells)
 ISAND = 1 means that Sanders' theory will be used. (ITEMs 128,410)
 ISAND = 2 means that Marlowe's theory will be used. (ITEM 411)
 The Donnell theory kinematic and "work done" terms are appear in
 Eqs (53) and (49b) on p 552 of Vol. 27 of Computers and
 Structures (1987 - "Theoretical basis of the PANDA......", with
 modifications described in ITEM 68 of the file PANDA2.NEWS.
 The Sanders theory is described in ITEMs 128, 410 of PANDA2.NEWS.
 The Marlowe theory is described in ITEM 411 of PANDA2.NEWS.

 The developer of PANDA2 now almost always uses ISAND = 1 . Don't
 worry about computer time. Computers run much faster now than
 they did when the following paragraph was written.

 You should always first do optimization first with ISAND = 0.
 On the last iteration for each "PANDAOPT", PANDA2 automatically
 checks buckling load factors with ISAND = 1 when the user provides
 ISAND = 0 in MAINSETUP. If results from these "last" iterations
 are significantly different from those corresponding to ISAND = 0,
 then the optimization must be run with ISAND = 1 or 2. ISAND = 1
 or 2 requires much more computer time than does ISAND = 0. Results
 from ISAND = 2 are rarely different from those from ISAND = 1.

 Index for type of shell theory (0 or 1 or 2), ISAND=h

 ISAND = 0 means Donnell theory is used (with appropriate
            correction for "live" pressure effect)
 ISAND = 1 means Sanders theory is used (See PANDA2.NEWS
            ITEM 128, 410 for details).
 ISAND = 2 means Marlowe theory is used (see PANDA2.NEWS
            ITEM 411 for details).

 The developer of PANDA2 now almost always uses ISAND = 1 . Don't
 worry about computer time. Computers run much faster now than
 they did when the following paragraph was written.

 Generally use ISAND = 0, as it runs much faster on the computer.
 In optimization runs (ITYPE=1) in which ISAND = 0,  PANDA2
 automatically checks margins with use of ISAND = 1 after the last
 design iteration in the current set of design iterations. If you
 use ISAND = 0, check the end of the *.OPM file to see if there
 are any significantly negative margins generated from the buckling
 analyses in which ISAND = 1. If so, then do optimization with
 ISAND = 1 or 2. You will rarely, if ever, need to use ISAND = 2,
 since for practical panels the Sanders and Marlowe theories give
 essentially the same results.

 Next, you will be asked:
 "Does the postbuckling axial wavelength of local buckles change?"
 What is meant is: "Does the postbuckling axial wavelength of local
 buckles change continuously as the applied load is increased above
 the load which causes initial local buckling of the panel skin
 between rings and stringers?"

 Just hit "Enter" if you don't know. The question is relevant only
 for analyses with IQUICK = 0, as it applies only to the postbuckling
 analysis, which is based on the discretized single panel module
 model. The default is "Y", and in practically all cases you should
 answer "Y" (or hit "Enter", which has the same effect). You should
 always answer "Y" if this run is to be an optimization run.

 You might want to answer "N" if your purpose in using PANDA2 is to
 generate post-local-buckling 3x3 tangent stiffness matrices to be
 compared with results from STAGS or some other general-purpose
 finite element computer code. In panels with the ratio of ring
 spacing to stringer spacing less than about 5 or 6, the axial
 wavelength of local buckling of the skin often stays constant
 for a rather large range in load above the initial local buckling
 load, especially in cases where axial compression Nx predominates
 and the applied in-plane shear load Nxy is small.

 Does the postbuckling axial wavelength of local buckles change?=<enter>
 Y

 Next, you will be asked, "Want to suppress general buckling
 mode with many axial waves?"

 You should usually answer N. Your answer affects the results
 only for ring-stiffened cylindrical panels subjected to
 external pressure.  In such cases there may be two types of
 general buckling (buckling of skin and stiffeners together):

    (1) general buckling in a mode with one axial halfwave.
    (2) general buckling in a mode with many axial halfwaves.

 If you answer Y, PANDA2 may set up a constraint condition that
 forces Mode Type (2) to have a load factor that is at least
 5 per cent higher than that associated with Mode Type (1).
 NOTE: THIS SPECIAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT SOMETIMES CAUSES THE
 DESIGN TO DRIFT AWAY FROM THE OPTIMUM CONFIGURATION. THEREFORE
 ANSWER "Y" ONLY IF YOU HAVE FIRST FOUND AN OPTIMUM WITH A "N"
 ANSWER. Answer H(elp) for further explanation, in particular.
 under what loading conditions the "many-axial-halfwave"
 buckling mode is to be suppressed.

 Want to suppress general buckling mode with many axial waves?=h

 Both types of buckling modes generally have several halfwaves
 over the circumference of the cylindrical (deep) panel or shell.
 Depending on the spacing and depth of the rings, either of these
 modes might be critical. If you answer N, PANDA2 will accept
 whichever type of general instability mode corresponds to the
 lowest general instability load factor. If you answer Y, PANDA2
 will set up a constraint condition that forces the general buckling
 load factor associated with the mode type (2) to be at least
 5 per cent higher than that associated with the mode type (1).
 This special constraint condition may make it difficult to settle
 on the best optimum: With successive PANDAOPTs, the designs, while
 feasible, may drift away from previously found configurations that
 weigh less. Therefore, it is best to start by answering N, finding
 an optimum design, then anwering Y and continuing, then returning
 to answering N again and doing more PANDAOPTs. NOTE: If you answer
 "Y", you may want to do a series of optimizations with fixed ring
 spacing. (Eliminate the ring spacing as a decision variable.)

 More on this item: A control integer IHIAXL equals 0 if the user
 answers "N" and IHIAXL = 1 if the user answers "Y". ILAMHI is
 another control integer that depends on the value of IHIAXL and
 on a third integer, IMLOC, to be explained next. ILAMHI is
 initially set equal to zero, and IMLOC is initially set equal
 to unity.

 IMLOC is a switch that determines whether or not general
 buckling load factors are to be saved corresponding to both low
 and high numbers of axial halfwaves in the buckling mode. If
 yes, then IMLOC = 0.  If IHIAXL and ILAMHI are both unity
 (IHIAXL is a user-supplied index and ILAMHI, initially zero,
 is possibly reset later), a constraint condition is set up by
 means of which the buckling load factor associated with the
 general buckling mode with the high number of axial halfwaves
 is forced to be at least 5 per cent higher than that associated
 with the general buckling mode with thelow number of axial
 halfwaves.

 In order for IMLOC to be set to zero, the norm of the applied
 axial and hoop stress resultants, sqrt(Nx^2 + Ny^2), must
 be greater than ten times the applied in-plane shear resultant
 Nxy, the hoop resultant Ny must by greater than 1.9 times the
 axial resultant Nx, and both Nx and Ny must be negative
 (compressive loading).

 Y

 Next, you will be asked, "Do you want to double-check PANDA-type
 eigenvalues?"  Please answer H for HELP if you are not familiar
 with this prompt.

 This double-check can take lots of computer time.  Generally
 answer N if the panel is flat.  Generally answer N if you
 plan to do optimization (ITYPE=1) or test simulation (ITYPE=3).
 Generally answer N if you are including transverse shear
 deformation effects: LOTS of computer time is required!

 The "double-check" very rarely has any effect on the results.
 However, if you are running an ITYPE=2 (fixed design) analysis
 for a final design configuration of a curved panel, you might
 answer Y.

 Do you want to double-check PANDA-type eigenvalues [type (H)elp]?=h

 This double-check can take lots of computer time.  Generally
 answer N if the panel is flat.  Generally answer N if you
 plan to do optimization (ITYPE=1) or test simulation (ITYPE=3).
 Generally answer N if you are including transverse shear
 deformation effects: LOTS of computer time is required!
 Generally answer Y if you are analyzing a fixed design of a
 curved panel in which in-plane shear loading is present and
 you are neglecting transverse shear deformation effects.
 Answer N if you are not near an optimum design. If you are
 near an optimum, or if you are suspicious of the load
 factors from the PANDA-type (closed form) analysis, answer
 Y.  If you answer Y and if there is in-plane shear loading
 or anisotropic terms in the C(i,j) matrix (constitutive law),
 then PANDA2 will check the minimum buckling load factors
 obtained by an initial (partial) search in slope space (slope
 of the nodal lines in the buckling mode shape) by calculating
 eigenvalues over a range of nodal line slopes from zero to
 10.0 for every wavenumber combination (m,n). This extra search
 takes more computer time, of course, so it shouldn't be done
 unless you feel you are near an optimum design or you doubt
 the PANDA-type eigenvalues.  (There is a partial double-check
 even if you answer N).

 Do you want to double-check PANDA-type eigenvalues [type (H)elp]?=<enter>
 N

 Next you will be asked to make a choice between two variations
 of the local postbuckling theory to be applied in your runs:

  (0) "transverse inextensional"       (0 is the preferred option)
  (1) "transverse extensional"

 The 0 option is preferred because it leads to more conservative
 designs and generally seems to agree better with test results,
 especially with regard to prediction of the number of axial
 halfwaves in the postbuckling regime. Also, the nonlinear
 equations governing the postbuckled state converge more reliably.

 The "transverse extensional" theory may agree better with
 tests and other analyses if the edges of the panel normal to the
 screen cannot deform in the plane of the panel (deform in the
 y-direction, that is, the direction in the plane of the panel
 and normal to the edges that run parallel to the stringers).
 However, Newton method fails to converge more often than is
 the case for the "inextensional" theory.

 The "transverse inextensional" theory is most appropriate if the
 edges of the panel normal to the screen are free to deform in the
 plane of the panel. This theory is generally conservative, as it
 leads to the prediction of local buckles with larger amplitudes.

 NOTE:  The projections of the two longitudinal edges (edges normal
        to the screen) onto the surface of the undeformed panel are
        ALWAYS free to move in the y-direction as straight lines.

 Choose (0=transverse inextensional; 1=transverse extensional)=<enter>
         1
 Choose ICONSV = -1 or 0 or 1 or H(elp), ICONSV=h

 Please use ICONSV = 1 as the preferred choice.

 ICONSV = 1 (recommended model) means:
   a. Include ARBOCZ theory when computing knockdown
      factors for local, inter-ring, general buckling.

   b. Use more conservative knockdown factors for models
      in which the stringers are smeared.

   c. Use computed knockdown factor for smearing rings

   d. The Donnell shell theory is used in SUBROUTINE STRIMP,
      where imperfection sensitivity is being computed.

   e. Will use the non-zero slope of buckling nodal lines
      in the computation of prebuckling bending and
      twisting, Wxx, Wyy, Wxy, of shells with general,
      inter-ring, and local buckling modal imperfections.
      (panda2.news Items 620 and 645 are cancelled).

 ICONSV = 0 (less conservative model) means:
   a. Do NOT include ARBOCZ theory when computing knockdown
      factors for local, inter-ring, general buckling.

   b. Use less conservative knockdown factors for models
      in which the stringers are smeared.

   c. Use computed knockdown factor for smearing rings
      (Same as for ICONSV = 1).

   d. The user-selected shell theory is used in SUBROUTINE
      STRIMP, where imperfection sensitivity is being
      computed.

   e. panda2.news Items 620 and 645 are cancelled. (Same
      as for e. under ICONSV = 1).

 ICONSV = -1 (still less conservative model) means:
   a. Do NOT include ARBOCZ theory when computing knockdown
      factors for local, inter-ring, general buckling.
      (Same as for ICONSV = 0)

   b. Use less conservative knockdown factors for models
      in which the stringers are smeared.
      (Same as for ICONSV = 0)

   c. Do NOT use computed knockdown factor for smearing rings
      (Knockdown factor for smearing rings = 1.0 EXCEPT when
       there exists significant local deformation in the
       outstanding flange of the ring in the "skin"-ring
       single discretized module general buckling model,
       in which case the knockdown factor is computed in
       the same way as for ICONSV = 1 and ICONSV = 0).

   d. Set the knockdown factor for truncated double-trig
      series expansion (altsol) models to RFACT = 0.95.
      (RFACT=0.85 for "altsol" models in which there are

   e. The user-selected shell theory is used in SUBROUTINE
      STRIMP, where imperfection sensitivity is being
      computed.

   f. panda2.news Items 620 and 645 are in force, that is,
      a non-zero slope of buckling nodal lines will
      probably be set to zero for the computation of Wxx,
      Wyy, and Wxy. (Different from e. under ICONSV = 0 and

                                     (FACIM1+FMULT2*FACIM2)

             IF (ICONSV.EQ.-1) FMULT2 = 10.0
             EIGEFF =(FACIM1*EILOC8 +FACIM2*FMULT2*EILC81)/
                                     (FACIM1+FMULT2*FACIM2)
      for inter-ring buckling, and

      the imperfect shell, and EILOC91, EILOC81, EILOC71

      for local buckling.

 Choose ICONSV = -1 or 0 or 1 or H(elp), ICONSV=<enter>
         1
 Choose type of analysis (ITYPE = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5)=h

 1  means an optimization analysis will be performed.
    Make sure that you have chosen decision variables, linked
    variables, geometrical inequality constraints, and escape
    variables via DECIDE.

 2  means PANDA2 will perform a buckling/stress analysis of a
    fixed design for up to 5 load sets.

 3  means PANDA2 will simulate a test of a panel with fixed
    design: For one of the load sets the behavior of the panel
    under monotonically increasing loads will be investigated.
    Note that this option requires that IQUICK = 0 for that
    load set which is selected by the user. Also, the KOITER
    branch MUST be entered. (IIKOIT=1)

 4  means that margins will be calculated for all design
    variables fixed except one user-selected variable. Margins
    will be calculated for a sequence of designs in which the
    user-selected variable is incremented from a user-selected
    starting value to a user-selected ending value.

 5  means that margins and interaction curves will be calculated
    for a user-selected in-plane load combination:
        (N1,N2) = (Nx,Ny) or (Nx,Nxy) or (Ny,Nxy)
    for a user-selected number of values of N1 and N2.

 Choose type of analysis (ITYPE = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5)=1
         1
 Do you want to prevent secondary buckling (mode jumping)?=h

 "Secondary Buckling" means mode jumping, or post-post-local buckling.
 Mode jumping is initiated by local bifurcation buckling in a panel
 skin which has already been loaded well beyond initial local buckling.
 Mode jumping might cause material failure, especially for composite
 walls that delaminate relatively easily.

 Example of secondary buckling: Suppose you have an axially stiffened
 panel under pure axial compression.  For axial loads well above that
 corresponding to local buckling of the panel skin between stringers
 the internal axial resultant Nx in the skin becomes concentrated near
 the stringers. The question is, under the redistributed Nx does local
 bifurcation buckling occur for a load factor less than unity? If so,
 then mode jumping is possible.

 NOTE: Your panel may become a lot heavier if you elect to prevent
       mode jumping. It may be a good idea to obtain optimum designs
       both with Y and N answers to this question. See the papers,
       AIAA-97-1141: "Optimization of stiffened panels in which
       mode jumping is accounted for" (1997 SDM Meeting), and
       AIAA-98-1990: "Optimization of panels with riveted z-shpaed
       stiffeners via PANDA2 (1998 SDM Meeting) for some guidance.

 Do you want to prevent secondary buckling (mode jumping)?=<enter>
 Y
 Do you want to use the "alternative" buckling solution?=h

 The "alternative" buckling solution is more accurate but uses
 much more computer time than the "regular" solution. The "regular"
 solution is the PANDA-type closed form solution obtained from the
 assumed displacement field given by Eqs. (50) in the paper,
 "Theoretical basis...", Computers and Structures, Vol. 27,
 pp 541-563, 1987, leading to Eq. (57) on p. 553 of that paper. The
 "alternative" solution is obtained via double-trig series
 expansions for buckling modal displacement components,  u, v, w.
 It is described in detail in ITEM 438 of ...panda2/doc/panda2.news.

 SUGGESTION: Start optimization by answering "N". Then finalize
 with use of the answer "Y".

 N


 Next you will be asked for the number of design iterations.
 This is the number of iterations corresponding to a single
 execution of PANDAOPT, not the total number of iterations
 to be processed for your entire case. It is almost always
 best to use a small number like 5 iterations. The best
 optimization strategy is explained in connection with Fig. 83
 on p. 582 of the long 1987 PANDA2 paper, "PANDA2 - Program
 for minimum weight design of stiffened, composite, locally
 buckled panels. Computers & Structures, Vol. 25, No. 4,
 pp. 469 - 605, 1987. You should get an optimum design by
 several executions of PANDAOPT with 5 iterations in each
 execution. Better yet, use SUPEROPT. With many executions of
 PANDAOPT and few design iterations with each execution you
 obtain the most efficient convergence to an optimum design.
 When you execute SUPEROPT you get more "starting" designs
 per SUPEROPT run when you use a small number like 5 for the
 number of iterations, therefore a more complete exploration of
 design space in the search for the best "global" optimum design.
 The developer of PANDA2 almost always uses 5 iterations.

 How many design iterations permitted in this run (5 to 25)?=h

 Choose a number between 5 and 25, usually 5 to 8.
 If the design margins seem to jump around quite a
 bit, or if the weight cycles from iteration set to
 iteration set, use a high number of iterations (20 or 25).

 How many design iterations permitted in this run (5 to 25)?=5
         5
 MAXMAR. Plot only those margins less than MAXMAR (Type H)=h

 Choose a number between  1  and  10.  1 to 5 is best.
 Every time you give the command PANDAOPT the results from
 the design iterations associated with the resulting batch
 run are stored in a binary file called NAME.PL1, in which
 NAME is your chosen name for the case. These results are
 re-organized in a processor called STORE and added to
 similarly re-organized results from previous PANDAOPT
 runs for the same case.  If MAXMAR is too large, you may
 be swamped with data (for example, hundreds of stress
 margins generated for multilayered composite panels)
 that you don't really need to see.  Try MAXMAR = 1 to 5.
 The bigger the case (more variables, more load sets, more
 iterations) the smaller MAXMAR should be. Note that MAXMAR
 must be greater than or equal to 1.

 MAXMAR. Plot only those margins less than MAXMAR (Type H)=<enter>
   1.000000
 Do you want to reset total iterations to zero (Type H)?=h

 PANDA2 accumulates results from all iterations from the
 start of the case. These results can be plotted via the
 processors CHOOSEPLOT and DIPLOT.  It is possible that
 you may no longer want to plot results from previous runs;
 you may want to make a "fresh" start, but with use of the
 current design state rather than the original design
 state from the NAME.BEG file.  You can do this by answering
 Y to this question.  Then ITRTOT will be set to zero.
 Likely occasions to reset ITRTOT to zero are:
 1. If you started from a very bad design state;
 2. If you are changing IQUICK, the integer that points to
    the type of analysis that you are doing;
 3. If you are changing one or more load sets or edge
    conditions.
 4. If you already have lots of iterations and plotting is
    too time consuming.

 Do you want to reset total iterations to zero (Type H)?=<enter>
 N
 Index for objective (1=min. weight, 2=min. distortion)=h

 1 means that PANDA2 will find the minimum weight of the panel.
   You must have previously assigned non-zero density to at
   least one part of the panel.

 2 means that PANDA2 will find the minimum distortion of the
   panel due to uniform temperature changes.  To use this option,
   you must have previously assigned non-zero coefficient of thermal
   expansion to at least one part of the panel, and you must have
   assigned nonzero curing temperature to all parts of the panel
   that have nonzero coefficients of thermal expansion. This curing
   temperature should be the same in all these parts. PANDA2
   minimizes the quantity

        DISTORTION=SQRT{ ET1**2 +ET2**2
                       +[TEFF(1)*ET4]**2 +[TEFF(2)*ET5]**2 }

   in which ET1, ET2, ET4, ET5 are the thermal strains and
   changes in curvature due to curing for the panel with smeared
   stiffeners and TEFF(1) and TEFF(2) are the effective thicknesses
   of the panel with smeared stiffeners in the axial and circ.
   coordinate directions, respectively.

 Index for objective (1=min. weight, 2=min. distortion)=<enter>
         1
 FMARG (Skip load case with min. margin greater than FMARG)=h

 Generally use FMARG > 0.5. FMARG must be greater than 0.1.
 If you have an optimization problem with many load sets, and
 a lot of computer time is required for design iterations,
 you might want to set FMARG to a number as low as 0.2 or even,
 in extremely long-running cases, to a number as small as 0.11.

 You should have as the first load case that which is most
 likely to generate the most critical design margins.

 In the first design iteration of each PANDAOPT, PANDA2 will
 explore all of the load cases and subcases. The test for possible
 elimination of a load subcase is applied only after completion
 of all calculations for the first design iteration. If the
 test on minimum margin for a load subcase indicates that that
 subcase should be skipped, it will be skipped for all remaining
 design iterations in the current PANDAOPT except the last,
 during which calculations for that load subcase are reintroduced.
 If that last iteration shows any negative margins, you must
 raise the value of FMARG before executing PANDAOPT again.
 Otherwise, the design that evolves will have negative margins.

This file or an edited version of it can be used for future executions
of the PANDA2 processor called "MAINSETUP". However, note that if you
change certain of the input values, there may occur different prompts
following the prompt corresponding to that change, and that therefore,
an edited version of the *.OPT file may not represent valid input for

PART 1.6: Execute the PANDA2 processor called "SUPEROPT" in
          order to search for a "global" optimum design.

bush-> superopt
The purpose of SUPEROPT is to launch the batch run which performs
multiple executions of the panda2 processors in the order:
  autochange  setup  pandaopt  pandaopt  pandaopt . . . .
The processor autochange automatically changes the decision variables
as follows:
           y(i) = x(i)*(1. + dx(i))   (i = 1,2,3,...no. of dec. var)
in which x(i) is the old value of the ith decision variable, y(i)
is the new value, and dx(i) is a random number between -0.5 and +1.5
The purpose of the successive cycles of
  autochange  setup  pandaopt  pandaopt  pandaopt . . . .
is to try to find a global optimum design by redesigning in each
cycle from a different starting point. The user should use a
small maximum number of design iterations (such as 5) in the file
case.OPT, where case is the user-specified name of the case.

Enter case name: cylstif
Enter number of executions of pandaopt
for each execution of autochange (5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10):5
B (background), F (foreground), or Q (NQS - network queue system): b

************* NOTE ************ NOTE *************** NOTE ************
The SUPEROPT run failed after 6 iterations because the
spacing between the stringers became too large for a model
in which IQUICK = 0. Here is part of the cylstif.ERR file:
 
------------------- part of the cylstif.ERR file -------------------

 IQUICK = quick analysis indicator (0 or 1)=         0


 ****** MODEL CHANGE REQUIRED ******
 Discretized model of single panel module cannot be treated
 because the stringer spacing spans too large a circumferential
 angle of the cylindrical panel or shell.

     STRINGER SPACING =   4.1494E+01
     CYLINDER RADIUS  =   1.0000E+02

 Please do one or more of the following

    1. set IQUICK = 1 (no discrete model of module is used) or
    2. make stringer spacing less than (cylinder radius)/3, or
    3. increase the cylinder radius or make panel module flat.
    4. if this message occurs at the end of a SUPEROPT run
       that bombed (see the *.ERR file) use "CHANGE" to save
       the best design so far (look at the end of *.OPP), and
       execute SETUP, MAINSETUP, and SUPEROPT again.
    5. read Item 675 of ...panda2/doc/panda2.news.
    6. possibly introduce an inequality constraint in DECIDE
       that forces B(STR) < (cylinder radius)/3.

PART 1.7: Reset the upper bound of the stringer spacing in the
          file, cylstif.DEC, and restart from scratch. 

In this case we will follow the alternative no. 2 listed above:

    2. make stringer spacing less than (cylinder radius)/3

We will do this by setting the upper bound of the stringer spacing
to less than radius/3. (We reset that upper bound to 30 inches.)
Then we will start over from the beginning of the case by first
"cleaning up" the cylstif files (cleanpan) and then executing the
PANDA2 processors, BEGIN, SETUP, DECIDE, MAINSETUP, SUPEROPT,
as follows:


bush-> cleanpan
Enter the case name: cylstif
You now have the following case cylstif files in your directory:
cylstif.BEG  cylstif.DEC  cylstif.OPT


bush-> begin
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


 ****************   BEGIN   ******************

 Purpose of BEGIN is to permit you to provide a starting design
 in an interactive mode. You give starting dimensions, material
 properties, allowables. The interactive session is stored on a
 file called cylstif.BEG, in which cylstif is a name that you have
 chosen for the case.(cylstif must remain the same as you use all
 the PANDA2 processors.)  In future runs of the same or a
 slightly modified case, you will find it convenient to use the
 file cylstif.BEG as input.  Rather than answer all the questions
 interactively, you can use cylstif.BEG or an edited version of
 cylstif.BEG as input to BEGIN.  BEGIN also generates an output
 file called cylstif.OPB. cylstif.OPB lists a summary of the case,
 and if you choose the tutorial option, the questions, helps,
 and your answers for each input datum.

 *************************************************

 Are you correcting, adding to, or using an existing file?=y

 (The "BEGIN" interactive session rolls by fast. Not reproduced
  here in order to save space.)

 Next, give a command  CHANGE or CHOOSETEMP  or   SETUP   .


bush-> setup
Enter case name: cylstif

 (Output from "SETUP" rolls by fast. Not reproduced
  here in order to save space.)

Pandaread pre-processor complete.
Next give the command: DECIDE or MAINSETUP.

************************* NOTE ****************************
Next, we edit the file, cylstif.DEC, in order to reduce
the upper bound of the stringer spacing from 50 inches
to 30 inches.

The part of the cylstif.DEC file involved before the edit
is as follows:

         1      $ Choose a decision variable (1,2,3,...)
        10      $ Lower bound of variable no.( 1)
        50      $ Upper bound of variable no.( 1)

and after the edit is as follows:

         1      $ Choose a decision variable (1,2,3,...)
        10      $ Lower bound of variable no.( 1)
        30      $ Upper bound of variable no.( 1)
********************** END NOTE ***************************


Then we run DECIDE:

bush-> decide
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


 *****************   DECIDE   *******************

 The purpose of DECIDE is to permit you to choose decision
 variables, linked variables, and escape variables for the
 optimization run or runs to follow. The results of the
 interactive session are saved in a file called cylstif.DEC, in
 which cylstif is your name for the case. You may find this file
 useful for future runs of DECIDE in which you want to avoid
 answering many questions interactively. DECIDE also generates
 a file called cylstif.OPD.  cylstif.OPD contains a summary of
 optimization parameters. If you choose the tutorial option,
 cylstif.OPD contains a complete list of the interactive session,
 including prompting questions, all "help" paragraphs, your
 responses to the prompting questions, and evolving lists
 of optimization parameters as they are chosen by you.

 ****************************************************

 Are you correcting, adding to, or using an existing file?=y

 (The "DECIDE" interactive session rolls by fast. Not
  reproduced here in order to save space.)

 Next, give either command  CHOOSETEMP or MAINSETUP   .


bush-> mainsetup
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


  *****************   MAINSETUP   ****************
 The purpose of this processor is to permit you to choose loads
 and initial imperfections, Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My, Nxo, Nyo, p,
 T(iseg), Wimp(global), Wimp(local),  (up to 5 sets of them);
 safety factors for general instability, panel instability,
 local instability (panel skin), local instability (stiffener
 parts), and stress; and strategy parameters for subsequent
 batch execution of an optimization analysis (analysis type 1);
 or an analysis of a fixed design at fixed load levels
 (analysis type 2); or an analysis of a fixed design for a
 single load set for monotonically increasing load levels
 (test simulation: analysis type 3).

 Results of the interactive session in MAINSETUP are saved on a
 file called cylstif.OPT, which will appear at the beginning of
 the cylstif.OPM file when the mainprocessor batch run launched
 by your command PANDAOPT has been completed.

 NOTE: JUST HIT "RETURN" FOR DEFAULT VALUE OF INPUT DATUM. IF
   PANDA2 REQUIRES AN INPUT, IT WILL SAY "PLEASE SAY SOMETHING"
  ***************************************************


 Are you correcting, adding to, or using an existing file?=y

 (The "MAINSETUP" interactive session rolls by fast. Not
  reproduced here in order to save space.)


Next, execute SUPEROPT again. This time it should not bomb
because the stringer spacing cannot exceed 30 inches, which
is less than a third of the radius of the cylindrical shell.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


PART 1.8: Execute the PANDA2 processor called "SUPEROPT" in
          order to search for a "global" optimum design.

bush-> superopt
The purpose of SUPEROPT is to launch the batch run which performs
multiple executions of the panda2 processors in the order:
  autochange  setup  pandaopt  pandaopt  pandaopt . . . .
The processor autochange automatically changes the decision variables
as follows:
           y(i) = x(i)*(1. + dx(i))   (i = 1,2,3,...no. of dec. var)
in which x(i) is the old value of the ith decision variable, y(i)
is the new value, and dx(i) is a random number between -0.5 and +1.5
The purpose of the successive cycles of
  autochange  setup  pandaopt  pandaopt  pandaopt . . . .
is to try to find a global optimum design by redesigning in each
cycle from a different starting point. The user should use a
small maximum number of design iterations (such as 5) in the file
case.OPT, where case is the user-specified name of the case.

Enter case name: cylstif
Enter number of executions of pandaopt
for each execution of autochange (5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10):5
B (background), F (foreground), or Q (NQS - network queue system): b
H (high) or L (low) priority: l
Diagnostics will be mailed to you upon program termination.

bush-> /usr/sbin/sendmail: No such file or directory


The SUPEROPT execution requires only about 12 minutes for about
470 design iterations. The tail end of the cylstif.OPP file,
which is output from SUPEROPT, has the following (abridged)
information:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


PART 1.9: Execute the PANDA2 processor called "CHOOSEPLOT" in
          order to choose what to plot.

Next, execute CHOOSEPLOT:

bush-> chooseplot
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


 ***************** CHOOSEPLOT  *******************
 The purpose of CHOOSEPLOT is to permit you to choose:

    1. Which design variables (decision variable candidates)
       are to be plotted v. design iterations (ITYPE=1);
    2. Which behaviors to plot v. load steps (ITYPE=3);
    3. Which sensitivity plots to obtain (ITYPE=4);
    4. At which locations to plot extreme fiber strains
       (ITYPE=3);
    5. Which design margins are to be plotted v. design
       iterations (ITYPE=1) or load steps (ITYPE=3) or
       design variable (ITYPE=4) or load combo (ITYPE=5).
    6. For which load steps to plot the deformed panel
       module (ITYPE=3).
    7. Whether or not to plot the layup configuration of the
       skin-stringer panel module (ITYPE=3)
    8. Whether or not to obtain a "3-D" plot of the locally
       post-buckled panel module (ITYPE=3)

 The results of the interactive session are saved in a file
 called cylstif.CPL, in which cylstif is your name for the case.
 You may find this file useful for future runs of CHOOSEPLOT
 in which you want to avoid answering many questions
 interactively. CHOOSEPLOT also generates the six files:
 cylstif.OPL, cylstif.PL3, cylstif.PL4, cylstif.PL5, cylstif.PL6,
 cylstif.PL7,cylstif.PL8,cylstif.PL9,cylstif.PL10, which are described
 briefly at the end of this run.
 If you choose the tutorial option, cylstif.OPL contains a
 complete list of the interactive session, including prompting
 questions, all "help" paragraphs, your responses to the
 prompting questions, and evolving lists of which parameters
 are to be plotted as they are chosen by you.

 DESCRIPTION OF FILES GENERATED BY THIS CASE:

 cylstif.CPL = Summary of interactive session you have just
          completed. This file can be edited and used for
          future runs of CHOOSEPLOT.
 cylstif.CBL = Contains the cylstif data base.
 cylstif.OPL = Output from CHOOSEPLOT. Please list this file and
          inspect it and the cylstif.CPL file carefully before
          proceeding.

 cylstif.PL3 = File for margin plots via DIPLOT
 cylstif.PL4 = File for design variable plots (ITYPE=1) or
            behavior v. load plots (ITYPE=3) or in-plane load
            interaction curves (ITYPE=5) via DIPLOT
 cylstif.PL5 = File for objective plot (ITYPE=1) or undeformed
            and deformed panel module (ITYPE=3) or in-plane
            load combinations (ITYPE=5) via DIPLOT
 cylstif.PL6 = File for plot of layup of skin-stringer module
             (ITYPE=3).

 cylstif.PL7 = File for "3-D" plot of locally post-buckled panel
            module. (ITYPE=3).
 cylstif.PL8 = File for plot of AXIAL or +45deg. extreme fiber
             strains v. a selected load component (ITYPE=3).
 cylstif.PL9 = File for plot of HOOP or -45deg. extreme fiber
             strains v. a selected load component (ITYPE=3).
 cylstif.PL10= File for plot of SHEAR strains at 0deg. or 45deg.
             v. a selected load component (ITYPE=3).

 For further information about files generated during operation
 of PANDA2 give the command HELPAN FILES.

 NEXT, INSPECT THE FILE cylstif.OPL AND THEN IF ALL IS OKAY,
 GIVE THE COMMAND:  DIPLOT   .


The interactive "CHOOSEPLOT" session produces the following file:

      n         $ Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?
      n         $ Any design variables to be plotted v. iterations (Y or N)?
      n         $ Any design margins to be plotted (Y or N)?
      y         $ Do you want a plot of the objective v. iterations (Y/N)?
      n         $ Do you want to get more plots before your next "SUPEROPT"?

This short file contains valid input for the next execution of CHOOSEPLOT.

PART 1.10: Execute the PANDA2 processor called "DIPLOT" in
           order to generate Postscript files for plotting.

bush-> diplot
Enter the PANDA2 case name: cylstif
Print the plot file on the printer called: <lp> (y or n)? n
The PostScript files, cylstif.3.ps through cylstif.10.ps, contain the

This plot contains the objective versus design iterations
during the SUPEROPT execution. In order to see the plot on
your screen, type the following command:

gv cylstif.5.ps

 ("gv" means "ghost view", a utility for reading Postscript
  files and producing the plot image on your screen.)

A screen "snapshot" of the plot is taken and stored in the file:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


PART 1.11: Execute the PANDA2 processors called "SUPEROPT" 
           and "DIPLOT"again in order to 1. search for a
           "global" optimum design that may weigh less than
           the optimum design determined so far, and 2. to
           plot the objective versus design iterations.

Next, run SUPEROPT again. Maybe there is a FEASIBLE or
ALMOST FEASIBLE design with a smaller weight than that
found in PART 1.8 and listed at the end of PART 1.8: 1.221E+04 lb.


bush-> superopt
The purpose of SUPEROPT is to launch the batch run which performs
multiple executions of the panda2 processors in the order:
  autochange  setup  pandaopt  pandaopt  pandaopt . . . .
The processor autochange automatically changes the decision variables
as follows:
           y(i) = x(i)*(1. + dx(i))   (i = 1,2,3,...no. of dec. var)
in which x(i) is the old value of the ith decision variable, y(i)
is the new value, and dx(i) is a random number between -0.5 and +1.5
The purpose of the successive cycles of
  autochange  setup  pandaopt  pandaopt  pandaopt . . . .
is to try to find a global optimum design by redesigning in each
cycle from a different starting point. The user should use a
small maximum number of design iterations (such as 5) in the file
case.OPT, where case is the user-specified name of the case.

Enter case name: cylstif
Enter number of executions of pandaopt
for each execution of autochange (5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10):5
B (background), F (foreground), or Q (NQS - network queue system): b
H (high) or L (low) priority: l
Diagnostics will be mailed to you upon program termination.

The abridged cylstif.OPP file includes the following
optimized design after completion of the second execution of
SUPEROPT:

It turns out there IS a slightly smaller optimized weight,
1.178E+04 lb versus the 1.221E+04 lb determined in PART 1.8.

Next, we want to obtain a plot of the objective versus
the design iterations during the second execution of SUPEROPT:

bush-> chooseplot
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif

 (We use the same input file for CHOOSEPLOT
  that we used after the first execution of
  SUPREOPT. The interactive CHOOSEPLOT execution
  rolls by on the screen very fast.)


bush-> diplot
Enter the PANDA2 case name: cylstif
Print the plot file on the printer called: <lp> (y or n)? n
The PostScript files, cylstif.3.ps through cylstif.10.ps, contain the
graphics for your plot.  They can be printed on any PostScript
printer or viewed on the console with a PostScript previewing
software program.

The Postscript file for plotting is:
-rw-r--r--   1 bush bush   30646 Feb 22 07:50 cylstif.5.ps

This plot contains the objective versus design iterations
during the SUPEROPT execution. In order to see the plot on
your screen, type the following command:

gv cylstif.5.ps

 ("gv" means "ghost view", a utility for reading Postscript
  files and producing the plot image on your screen.)

A screen "snapshot" of the plot is taken and stored in the 

cylstif.superopt2.objective.png


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


PART 1.12: Execute the PANDA2 processor called "MAINSETUP" again
           in order to set up a run for a fixed design (ITYPE=2):
           the optimum design with the weight, 1.178E+04 lb.

Next, we wish to obtain results for the optimized design.
We edit the cylstif.OPT file (input for MAINSETUP) by
changing ITYPE from 1 (optimization) to 2 (analysis of a
fixed design):

  2   $ Choose type of analysis (ITYPE = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5)

We also change the output index, NPRINT, from 0 to -1, as
follows:

 -1   $ NPRINT= output index (-1=min. 0=good, 1=ok, 2=more, 3=too much)

This is done only for the purpose of this presentation.
Ordinarily, you would use NPRINT = 0 or NPRINT = 2


Next, we execute MAINSETUP with the new values for ITYPE (ITYPE=2)
and NPRINT (NPRINT = -1):

Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif

  *****************   MAINSETUP   ****************
 The purpose of this processor is to permit you to choose loads
 and initial imperfections, Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My, Nxo, Nyo, p,
 T(iseg), Wimp(global), Wimp(local),  (up to 5 sets of them);
 safety factors for general instability, panel instability,
 local instability (panel skin), local instability (stiffener
 parts), and stress; and strategy parameters for subsequent
 batch execution of an optimization analysis (analysis type 1);
 or an analysis of a fixed design at fixed load levels
 (analysis type 2); or an analysis of a fixed design for a
 single load set for monotonically increasing load levels
 (test simulation: analysis type 3).

 Results of the interactive session in MAINSETUP are saved on a
 file called cylstif.OPT, which will appear at the beginning of
 the cylstif.OPM file when the mainprocessor batch run launched
 by your command PANDAOPT has been completed.

 NOTE: JUST HIT "RETURN" FOR DEFAULT VALUE OF INPUT DATUM. IF
   PANDA2 REQUIRES AN INPUT, IT WILL SAY "PLEASE SAY SOMETHING"
  ***************************************************

 Are you correcting, adding to, or using an existing file?=y

 (The interactive "MAINSETUP" session rolls by on the screen
  very fast. We next give the command, PANDAOPT, and thereby
  obtain results for the fixed, optimized design.)

PART 1.13: Execute the PANDA2 processor called "PANDAOPT" for
           the analysis of the fixed, optimized design

bush-> pandaopt

The purpose of PANDAOPT is to launch the batch run which performs
optimization or buckling according to the strategy parameters
established the last time you did a MAINSETUP. Output from PANDAOPT
is stored in a file called casename.OPM, in which casename is
the name of the case. You will want to examine casename.OPM as soon
as PANDAOPT is finished.

Enter case name: cylstif

PART 1.15: Execute the PANDA2 processor called "CHANGE" 
           in order to archive the optimized design

Next, we wish to save the optimized design by executing the
interactive session, "CHANGE", as follows:

bush-> change
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


 ******************   CHANGE   *******************

 You use CHANGE to change parameters without having to go back
 to BEGIN. The parameters you can change are segregated into
 three groups:

    1. parameters elegible to be decision variables
    2. parameters not elegible to be decision variables
    3. allowables (for example, max. strain).

 Your interactive input is saved on a file called cylstif.CHG, in
 which cylstif is the same name you used for BEGIN, SETUP, etc.
 A summary of the output from CHANGE is stored in cylstif.OPC.

 ************************************************************

 Are you correcting, adding to, or using an existing file?=n
 n
 Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?=n
 n

 This program permits you to change certain quantities without
 starting over from the beginning (without having to use BEGIN).

 Parameters that you can change are segregated into three sets:

    1. parameters that are "elegible" to be decision variables;
    2. parameters that are always considered to be fixed
       during design iterations: they are not elegible
       to be decision variables;
    3. parameters that are allowables, such as max. stress.

 You will next be asked if you want to change any parameters in
 set no. 1, and if so, which; then you will be asked the same
 questions relative to set no. 2; and finally the same questions
 relative to set no. 3.

 Do you want to change any values in Parameter Set No. 1?=y

PART 1.19: Selected output from the cylstif.OPM file obtained
           when the output index, NPRINT = 2, in the cylstif.OPT file 

This section is quite long, but it is important as it demonstrates:
1. What sort of calculations PANDA2 performs, and
2. What the predictions are obtained from certain of the "CHAPTERS",
as listed next.

Here follows some selected output contained in the cylstif.OPM file
for the perfect shell included when the print index, NPRINT = 2,
in the *.OPT (cylstif.OPT) file (*.OPT = input for MAINSETUP).

NOTE: There appear below some references to previously published
papers, notations such as "[1K]", "[1L]", etc. These designations
occur in Reference 1 of the following paper:

ANOTHER NOT: The string, "t.s.d." occurs:

 CHAPTER NEW Compute wide-column buckling from discretized
            skin-stringer module model (Figs. 20b,c & 22b,c in
            [1A]) with only Nx (Ny=0, Nxy=0). The purpose is to
            obtain a knockdown factor, WIDKNK, for smearing
            the stringers in an inter-ring buckling mode

 CHAPTER NEW1 Compute distribution of loads in panel module
            skin-stringer segments, neglecting redistribution
            due to initial buckling modal imperfections
            (See Section 10 of [1A]). These loads are for
            computing a preliminary value of wide column
            buckling, needed for smeared stringer knockdown.

 CHAPTER NEW2 List prebuckling stress resultants, Nx, Ny,
        needed for the discretized single-module skin-stringer
        model used for a preliminary value of wide column
        buckling (BOSOR4-type model: see Figs. 18, 20,
        22, 97, and 98 of [1A], for examples of the
        discretized single skin-stringer BOSOR4-type
        module model.). This distribution of Nx is used in
        the wide column model used to obtain the smeared
        stringer knockdown factor, WIDKNK. Ny and Nxy and the
        fixed (non-eigenvalue) loads, Nxo, Nyo, Nxyo are set
        to zero for this computation of wide column buckling.

 (lines skipped to save space)

 CHAPTER NEW3 Do wide-column inter-ring buckling analysis.
            (See Figs. 20c, 22c, 46d, and 67 of [1A],
            for examples.). The purpose of this computation
            is to obtain a smeared stringer knockdown factor.

PART 2.1 Execute the PANDA2 processor called "PANEL" in
         order to produce a valid input file, cylstif.ALL,
         for BIGBOSOR4 for a prismatic model for LOCAL buckling 

Next, get a plot from BIGBOSOR4 of buckling of the portion of the 
shell between rings from a BIGBOSOR4 model generated via the PANDA2
processor called PANEL. In this BIGBOSOR4 model the T-stringers
are modeled as flexible shell segments and the T-rings are replaced
by simple supports. The axial length of the prismatic shell
included in the BIGBOSOR4 model is B(RNG), the ring spacing. Half of
the circumference of the cylindrical shell is included in the model.
The axial length of the model is 10.110 inches, which is the optimized
ring spacing. The prismatic shell BIGBOSOR4 model is used.

  ****************  PANEL  *******************

  The purpose of PANEL is to set up an input file, NAME.ALL,
  for a multi-module model of a panel. NAME is your name for
  the case. The file NAME.ALL is a BIGBOSOR4 input "deck" used
  by the batch run you launch next via the command BIGBOSORALL.

 0 means edge is half a stringer spacing away from nearest

 Enter ILOCAL=0 or 1 or -1 or -2 (Type (H)elp), ILOCAL=h

 ILOCAL=0  (panel buckling) means that tangent stiffnesses will
 be used for the wall stiffnesses.  The Nx, Ny, Nxy distributions
 over the panel module cross section are those calculated in the
 Koiter branch of PANDA2, that is, Nx, Ny, Nxy are for the locally
 postbuckled panel. You will generally select NWAVE=1 axial
 halfwaves when you are asked to supply a value for NWAVE. The
 axial length of the shell is the length between adjacent rings.

 ILOCAL = 1 (local buckling) means that original stiffnesses will
 be used for the wall stiffnesses of the various segments in the
 panel module. The Nx, Ny, Nxy distributions over the panel module
 cross section are those calculated from SUBROUTINE FORCEX, that
 is, Nx, Ny, Nxy are for the panel with no local buckling. You
 will generally select NWAVE = number of axial halfwaves that
 corresponds to the minimum local buckling load factor, EIGOLD,
 computed by PANDA2. (See the *.OPM file). The axial length of the
 shell is the length between adjacent rings.

 ILOCAL = -1 (general buckling) The original stiffnesses are used
 for the shell skin with smeared rings [CY(i,j,5)]. The tangent
 stiffnesses are used for the stringer segments. The axial length
 of the shell model is the total length of the shell multiplied by
 the axial length modifier, LENMOD. Rings are smeared in this model.

 ILOCAL = -2 (general buckling) The original stiffnesses are used
 for the shell skin with all stiffeners smeared [CS(i,j)]. The
 axial length of the shell model is the total length of the shell
 multiplied by the axial length modifier, LENMOD.

 Enter ILOCAL=0 or 1 or -1 or -2 (Type (H)elp), ILOCAL=1
         1
 Number of halfwaves in the axial direction [see H(elp)],NWAVE=h

 For general instability, NWAVE is usually equal to 1.

 For a value you might use, inspect the NAME.OPM file. In the
 list of buckling margins you will find the number of axial
 halfwaves predicted via PANDA2 for various kinds of buckling.

 You can use PANEL/BOSORALL to check the PANDA2 results via
 BOSOR4 for general and/or local buckling, and for buckling
 of the stiffener parts, and for stiffener rolling. Please note
 that:
  1. BOSOR4 does not account for shear loading in its predictions
     of buckling, so that PANDA2 and BOSOR4 results will agree
     only if there is no applied in-plane shear loading.
  2. BOSOR4 does not account for the transverse shear deformation
     effect.

PART 3.0: Processing with CHANGE, STAGSUNIT, and STAGS 
****************************************************

PART 3.1 Edit the file, cylstif.CHG, (See PART 1.15) in 
         order to create dimensions that are "STAGS-worthy"
         (integral numbers of stringer spacings & ring spacings
          over the circumference and length of the cylindrical
          shell)

Next, we wish to set up STAGS models of the optimized T-ring and T-stringer
stiffened cylindrical shell. First, we must use the PANDA2 processor,
CHANGE, to make sure that there are an integral number of stringers over
360 degrees of circumference and an integral number of rings over the
300-inch length. Accordingly, we do the following:

We first edit the file, cylstif,CHG, changing the optimized values of
B(STR) = 10.110,   B2(STR) = 3.3697, and B(RNG) = 31.85 inches to
B(STR) = 10.13417, B2(STR) = 3.3777, and B(RNG) = 33.3333. With
B(STR) = 10.13417 inches there are exactly 62 stringers over 360
degrees of circumference, and with B(RNG) = 33.3333 inches there
are exactly 9 ring spacings over the length, 300 inches. The new
cylstif.CHG file follows:

PART 3.2 Execute the PANDA2 processors called "CHANGE" and "SETUP"

Next, we execute CHANGE and SETUP:

bush-> change
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif

 ******************   CHANGE   *******************

 You use CHANGE to change parameters without having to go back
 to BEGIN. The parameters you can change are segregated into
 three groups:

    1. parameters elegible to be decision variables
    2. parameters not elegible to be decision variables
    3. allowables (for example, max. strain).

 Your interactive input is saved on a file called cylstif.CHG, in
 which cylstif is the same name you used for BEGIN, SETUP, etc.
 A summary of the output from CHANGE is stored in cylstif.OPC.

PART 3.5 Execute the PANDA2 processor called "STAGSUNIT" in
         order to generate valed input files *.bin & *.inp for STAGS.
         In this first STAGSUNIT case we include the entire cylindrical
         shell in the STAGS model with the T-rings and T-stringers all
         modeled with flexible shell segments (Shell units in STAGS
         jargon).

Next, in order to generate the STAGS model, execute the PANDA2 processor
called STAGSUNIT:


bush-> stagsunit
Please enter PANDA2 case name: cylstif


  ****************  STAGSUNIT *******************

  The purpose of STAGSUNIT is to produce input files,

            NAME.inp,  NAME.bin  and  NAME.ppn

  for a multi-module model of a panel. NAME is your name for
  the case. The files NAME.inp, NAME.bin can be used as input
  for the  STAGS  computer program.  STAGS is a general finite
  element code for the nonlinear static and dynamic analysis
  of stiffened shell structures.  You should use STAGS to
  check the load-carrying capacity of the panels you designed
  with PANDA2. The file NAME.ppn can be used directly as input
  for the STAGS postprocessor, POSTP.  STAGSUNIT also creates
  a file called NAME.STG, which can be used as input for
  future runs of STAGSUNIT.

 Choose type of STAGS analysis (1,3,4,5,6),INDIC=h

 INDIC = 1 means linear bifurcation buckling analysis. The
           purposes are:
           (a) to compare with PANDA2 predictions for local
               and/or general buckling load factors and mode shapes;
           (b) to obtain one or more buckling mode shapes to be
               used later with an INDIC = 3 nonlinear analysis
               of an imperfect shell.
               The imperfections are in the shapes of user-selected
               buckling modes predicted with the INDIC=1 analysis.

 INDIC = 3 means nonlinear static analysis over a user-provided
           range of loads, analogous to the ITYPE=3 analysis
           (test simulation) with PANDA2.

 The user should first run STAGSMODEL or STAGSUNIT with INDIC = 1,
 followed by subsequent runs of STAGSMODEL or STAGSUNIT with INDIC = 3.
 If STAGS cannot continue to obtain solutions for load factors that
 approach the general instability or wide-column buckling load predicted
 by PANDA, then it will be necessary to use a more complex strategy
 involving the other analysis types, INDIC = 4, 5, and 6:

 INDIC = 4 means bifurcation buckling with nonlinear prebuckling.
         To be used if the user wants a new imperfection shape.

 INDIC = 5 means small vibrations with nonlinear prebuckling.
         To be used in order to get appropriate time step for
         nonlinear transient analyses.

 INDIC = 6 means nonlinear transient response analysis. (see
         PANDA2.NEWS ITEM 259 and AIAA Paper No. 97-1141).

 Choose type of STAGS analysis (1,3,4,5,6),INDIC=1
         1
 Restart from ISTARTth load step (0=1st nonlinear soln), ISTART=h

 If this is NOT a STAGS POSTPROCESSOR run:
   ISTART = 0 Always use ISTART = 0 if INDIC = 1
   ISTART = 0 means you are starting the nonlinear analysis and
              have no previous load steps to start from.
   ISTART > 0 means you are using the solution at load step
              number ISTART as a starting solution for the next
              STAGS run.  If ISTART > 0 make sure that the starting
              load factors STLD(1) and STLD(2) on the C-1 record
              correspond to load step ISTART.

 If this IS a STAGS POSTPROCESSOR run:
   ISTART = n is the load step number for which you want to
              generate data via the STAGS postprocessor POSTP.
              n = 0 means you will get the linear response.

 Restart from ISTARTth load step (0=1st nonlinear soln), ISTART=0
         0
 Local buckling load factor from PANDA2, EIGLOC=h

 Use EIGLOC = 0 unless INDIC = 1  (bifurcation buckling).

 You can find EIGLOC in the NAME.OPM file. Look for the margin
 or margins corresponding to local buckling. The load factor
 for local buckling is given by:

            EIGLOC = FSLOC*(MARGIN + 1.)

 in which FSLOC is the factor of safety for local buckling.

 Local buckling load factor from PANDA2, EIGLOC=1.155
   1.155000
 Are the dimensions in this case in inches?=y
 y
 Nonlinear (0) or linear (1) kinematic relations?, ILIN=h

 Ordinarily, you should set ILIN = 0

 However, occasionally general buckling mode shapes are
 "dirty". That is, smooth relatively long-wavelength general
 buckling modes are "polluted" by very short-wavelength
 "noise". Example: see Fig. 39, p 1612 of "Optimization of perfect
 and imperfect ring and stringer stiffened cylindrical shells
 with PANDA2 and evaluation of the optimum designs with STAGS",
 AIAA Paper 2002-1408, Proceedings of the AIAA 43rd SDM
 Conference, Denver, CO, 2002, pp 1562-1613.

 With ILIN = 1 much, perhaps all, of the short-wavelength
 "noise" will be filtered out. Try ILIN = 0 first. If you get
 "polluted" general buckling mode shapes which are usually
 unsuitable to use as initial imperfection shapes, use
 ILIN = 1 for the linear bifurcation buckling analysis.

 NOTE: For the nonlinear (INDIC=3) STAGS runs, always use
 ILIN = 0

 Nonlinear (0) or linear (1) kinematic relations?, ILIN=0
         0
 Type 1 for closed (360-deg) cyl. shell, 0 otherwise, ITOTAL=h

 If you are modeling a cylindrical shell that spans 360
 degrees, answer ITOTAL = 1

 If you are modeling a flat or cylindrical panel that spans
 less than 360 degrees then answer ITOTAL = 0 except in the
 following circumstance:

 If you are setting up a compound cylindrical model and the
 compound model spans 360 degrees, answer ITOTAL = 1.

 See Fig. 56 in the paper, "Difficulties in optimization of
 imperfect stiffened cylindrical shells", AIAA Paper 2006-1943,
 47th AIAA SDM Meeting, Newport, RI May 1-4, 2006, for an
 example of a "compound" model. If the compound model is a
 complete (360-degree) cylindrical shell it is closed (ITOTAL=1).
 The logic will proceed as if the shell is closed even though
 you set YSTAGS to a value considerably less than that which
 corresponds to 360 degrees.

 Type 1 for closed (360-deg) cyl. shell, 0 otherwise, ITOTAL=1
         1
 X-direction length of the STAGS model of the panel: XSTAGS=h

 This is the axial length of the part of the panel to be included
 in the STAGS model. (The X-direction is along the stringer axis).

 If PANDA2 indicates that there are many axial waves in the local
 buckling pattern, then it may be best to use STAGS to explore only
 the local bifurcation and post-bifurcation behavior, rather than
 the general instability behavior. In such a case you might choose
 a length XSTAGS that is equal to no more than about 10 axial
 half-waves of the local buckling pattern.

 X-direction length of the STAGS model of the panel: XSTAGS=300.
       300
 Panel length in the plane of the screen, L2=h

 For a cylindrical panel, this is the arc length along the
 circumference of the entire panel.  A complete cylindrical
 shell can be modelled by using  L2 = pi*radius. Then the number
 of half-waves over this circumferential length is the same as
 the number of full waves around the complete 360 degree circum-
 ference.  If you are analyzing a complete cylindrical shell,
 especially one with loads that vary around the circumference,
 it will probably be best to divide it into panels. Then analyze
 the panel as a structure subjected to multiple sets of uniform
 loads.  (See the paper, PANDA2--program for minimum weight
 design of stiffened, composite, locally buckled panels, for an
 example. Computers and Structures, Vol. 25, pp 570-574, Fig. 79)

 Panel length in the plane of the screen, L2=628.31854
   628.3185
 STAGSUNIT MAY HAVE CHANGED YOUR INPUT VALUE OF YSTAGS:
 YOUR INPUT VALUE OF ARC LENGTH OF THE PANEL, YSTAGS=  6.2832E+02
 STAGSUNIT HAS CHANGED THE ARC LENGTH TO      YSTAGS=  6.2832E+02
 WHICH IS EXACTLY EQUAL TO A MULTIPLE OF THE STRINGER SPACING.
 Is the nodal point spacing uniform along the stringer axis?=h

 Generally answer Y. If you have a panel in which bending
 is significant, and if PANDA2 predicts many axial halfwaves
 in the local buckling pattern, (more than 10, for example),
 then you might answer N. You will then be asked further
 questions about the distribution of nodal points in the axial
 direction, x.

 If local buckling occurs only near the midlength of the
 panel (because of bending under pressure, for example)
 then you might want to concentrate nodal points in that region.
 If local buckling might occur both near the midlength of the
 panel and near the ends (bending of a clamped panel under
 pressure, for example) then you might want to concentrate
 nodal points near the midlength and near one or both ends
 of the panel.

 Is the nodal point spacing uniform along the stringer axis?=y
 y
 Number of nodes in the X-direction: NODEX=h

 NODEX must be an odd integer. It may be changed later.
 The X-direction is the direction along the stringer axis.
 You should have at least three nodes per axial halfwave of
 the local buckling pattern.

 This input datum is not used if there are rings.

 Number of nodes in the X-direction: NODEX=51
        51
 Number of nodes in the Y-direction: NODEY=h

 NODEY must be an odd integer. It may be changed later.
 The Y-direction is the direction around the circumference.
 You should have at least three nodes per circumferential
 halfwave of the general or inter-ring buckling pattern.

 This input datum is not used if there are stringers that
 are not to be smeared out.

 Number of nodes in the Y-direction: NODEY=101
       101

 You will next be asked to provide loads for Load Set A
 (Nx, Ny, Nxy, p) followed by loads for Load Set B (Nx0, Ny0, p0)
 for the STAGS finite element model.

 Now provide loads (Nx, Ny, Nxy, p) for Load Set A.

 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) normal to the plane of screen, Nx=h

 What is wanted is the applied line load in the L1 (axial)
 direction in units of force/length. Negative for compression.
 If this axial load varies in the L2 (circumferential) direction,
 use the largest compressive value applied to that edge of the
 panel.

 What is wanted now is the axial load in Load Set A, that is
 the eigenvalue load: the load to be multiplied by the critical
 load factor (the eigenvalue) in computations of the critical
 applied load.

 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) normal to the plane of screen, Nx=-25000.
  -25000.00
 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) in the plane of the screen,    Ny=-50000.
  -50000.00
 In-plane shear in load set A,                  Nxy=0.
   0.000000
 Normal pressure in STAGS model in Load Set A, p=h

 If the panel is curved, the normal pressure p must be
 consistent with the applied hoop resultant Ny:
 p*r = Ny, in which r = cylindrical shell radius.
 (r is always positive).

 Normal pressure in STAGS model in Load Set A, p=h
  There is no more help. Do your best.
 Normal pressure in STAGS model in Load Set A, p=-500.
  -500.0000

 Next, provide loads for Load Set B (Nx0, Ny0, p0) in the
 STAGS finite element model.

 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) normal to the plane of screen, Nx0=0
         0
 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) in the plane of the screen,    Ny0=0
         0
 Normal pressure in STAGS model in Load Set B, p0=0
         0
 Starting load factor for Load System A, STLD(1)=h

 Use 1.0 for INDIC = 1 (linear buckling) analyses.

 For transient restarts from nonlinear static runs that got stuck
 because of singularities on the primary load path, use the load
 factor corresponding to one or two steps back from the last step
 converged. STAGS does not yet properly store information for the
 last step successfully completed if the run stopped because of
 maximum number of cuts in step. For example, if STAGS could not
 get a converged solution for Load Step 31, then for some reason
 Load Step 30 is not properly stored. Therefore, you should use
 the load factor corresponding to Load Step 29 or perhaps 28.
 PANDA2 will automatically supply an appropriate value for the
 actual load factor to be used in the transient analysis. This
 PANDA2-provided value will be a bit higher than the highest load
 factor reached by STAGS in the case so that the structure will
 start to move to a new state.

 Starting load factor for Load System A, STLD(1)=1.0
   1.000000
 Load factor increment for Load System A, STEP(1)=h

 Use zero for linear buckling analysis (INDIC=1) and transient
 analysis (INDIC=6).

 Load factor increment for Load System A, STEP(1)=0.
   0.000000
 Maximum load factor for Load System A, FACM(1)=h

 Use FACM(1) = 1.0 for eigenvalue (INDIC=1) and transient (INDIC=6)
 analysis types.

 Maximum load factor for Load System A, FACM(1)=1.0
   1.000000
 Starting load factor for Load System B, STLD(2)=0
         0
 Load factor increment for Load System B, STEP(2)=0
         0
 Maximum load factor for Load System B, FACM(2)=0
         0
 How many eigenvalues do you want? NEIGS=h

 This input datum is for the STAGS input file.

 If the STAGS analysis type INDIC=1 (buckling of unloaded
 structure) you will probably want NEIGS = 1 to 8.

 If the STAGS analysis type INDIC=5 (vibration of loaded
 structure) you will probably want NEIGS = 1  . The purpose
 of the eigenvalue analysis in this case is to establish a
 reasonable estimate for the time step in a subsequent dynamic
 response analysis.

 If the STAGS analysis type INDIC=4 (buckling of loaded
 structure) you may well want to use NEIGS > 1  . NEIGS must
 be less than twenty.  Probably should be from 4 to 8.

 How many eigenvalues do you want? NEIGS=1
         1
 Choose element type: 480 or 410 or 940=h


 Descriptions of the 480, 410, and 940 elements appear
 in the STAGS user's manual. The 480 finite element is
 the one favored by the developer of PANDA2.

 The 940 element usually converges from above.

 Choose element type: 480 or 410 or 940=480
       480
 Have you obtained buckling modes from STAGS for this case?=h

 In order to include the effect of initial imperfections
 in the STAGS model, you must have previously generated buckling
 modes from either an INDIC = 1 (linear bifurcation) analysis or
 an INDIC = 4 (bifurcation from nonlinear prebuckled state)
 analysis.

 If your answer is N the amplitude of the imperfection
 WIMPL that you provided above will be set to zero, and your
 STAGS run will therefore NOT include the effect of initial
 imperfections.  If you want to include the effect of initial
 imperfections, run STAGS with either the INDIC = 1 or
 INDIC = 4 options first.

 Have you obtained buckling modes from STAGS for this case?=n
 n
 Number of stringers in STAGS model of 360-deg. cylinder=h

 The first stringer is at circ. angle, theta = 0 degrees
 and the last stringer is at theta=(360-dtheta), in which
 dtheta is the circ. angle between the lines of attachment
 of adjacent stringers.

 NOTE: Make sure that the stringer spacing is equal to
       the PANDA2 variable called B(1), or B(STR). You
       may have to run PANDA2 again with B(1) set so that
       there are exactly the right number of uniformly spaced
       stringers in the complete (360-deg.) cylindrical shell.

 Number of stringers in STAGS model of 360-deg. cylinder=62
        62
 Number of rings in the STAGS model of the panel=h

 The first ring may be at the beginning of the panel
 or it may be one-half ring spacing in from this edge,
 depending on how you answer the next question.

 NOTE: Make sure that the ring spacing is equal to the PANDA2
       variable called B(2), or B(RNG). You may have to run
       PANDA2 again with B(2) set so that there are exactly
       the right number of uniformly spaced rings over the
       axial length in the STAGS model. Alternatively, you
       may have to change the axial length of the STAGS model.

 Number of rings in the STAGS model of the panel=10
        10
 Are there rings at the ends of the panel?=y
 y
 Number of finite elements between adjacent stringers=h

 If you are using the 410 finite element, make this
 at least two.

 NOTE: If you answer 0 PANDA2 will ask you to provide
 the number of finite elements in the circumferential
 direction. In such a case the stringers must be
 smeared out.

 Number of finite elements between adjacent stringers=1
         1
 Number of finite elements between adjacent rings=h

 If you are using the 410 finite element, make this
 at least two.

 NOTE: If you answer 0 PANDA2 will ask you to provide
 the number of finite elements in the axial
 direction. In such a case the rings must be
 smeared out and the nodal point spacing in the

 Stringer model: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5(Type H(elp))=h

 Input must be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5

       1 = all stringer segments are modeled as beams (210
           elements) that are attached to the cyl. shell.

       2 = stringer webs are modeled as shell branches (410 or 480)
           and any faying and/or outstanding flanges are modelled
           as beams (210 elements). The faying flanges are attached
           to the cylindrical shell and the outstanding flanges are
           attached at the tips of the stringer webs.

       3 = all stringer segments are modeled as shell branches.

       4 = stringer faying flange is modeled as beam (210 elements),
           but stringer web and stringer outstanding flange are
           modeled as shell branches.

       5 = the stringers are replaced by enforcement of a constraint
           that the normal displacement w be constant along the
           generator where the stringer would be attached to the
           cylindrical shell.

 Reference surface of cyl: 1=outer, 0=middle, -1=inner=h

 Choose either 1 or 0 or -1
 If the stringers are external you may want to choose  1
 If the stringers are internal you may want to choose -1
 If the height of the stringers is large compared to
 the thickness of the cyl. shell, you should choose    0
 If you are planning to use fasteners, please choose 0

 Reference surface of cyl: 1=outer, 0=middle, -1=inner=0
         0
 Do you want to use fasteners (they are like rigid links)?=h

 Usually you should answer N. However, if at the optimum
 design the height of the stringers is not large compared
 to the thickness of the cylindrical shell, and if you
 answered 0 to the previous question about location of the
 reference surface of the cylindrical shell. then you might
 want to answer Y. Note that the use of fasteners
 approximately numerically doubles the size of the case.

 Fasteners are used to permit a gap between the reference
 surface of the cylindrical shell and the roots of the
 stringers and rings (when these stiffeners are modelled
 as shell branches rather than as beams).

 The fasteners act like tiny springs between "fastened" nodes.
 The fastener spring constant is chosen automatically by
 STAGSUNIT. It is set rather high in order that fasteners
 act in a manner similar to rigid links.

 Are the stringers to be "smeared out"?=h

 Generally, you should answer N.

 Generally, you should answer N.

 Are the rings to be "smeared out"?=n
 n
 Number of nodes over height of stiffener webs, NODWEB=h

 You must provide an odd integer.

 First try a small number such as 3. In a convergence study,
 or with models in which the cylindrical shell does not have
 a huge number of nodes (huge = 500000 or more), or with models
 in which there are not many stiffeners, you can try more,
 especially if you suspect that significant web bending occurs
 during buckling and/or nonlinear collapse. In STAGSUNIT the
 webs of both stringers and rings will have the same number of
 nodal points over their heights.

 Number of nodes over height of stiffener webs, NODWEB=5
         5
 Number of nodes over width of stringer flange, NDFLGS=5
         5
 Number of nodes over width of ring flange, NDFLGR=5
         5

 This section pertains to STAGS models generated via STAGSUNIT.
 You will next be asked if you want stringer(s) and/or ring(s)
 to have a denser finite element mesh than all the others
 in the STAGS model. Ordinarily you should answer N (no).
 First, you will be asked with regard to stringers, then
 with regard to rings. For each category (stringers, rings),
 if you answer Y, you will next be asked to give the stringer
 number(s) or ring number(s) which are to have the higher nodal
 point density. The stringers are numbered from the bottom to
 the top (or right to left). The rings are numbered from
 the bottom to the top (or left to right). See Fig. 2 of
 the paper, "Difficulties in optimization...", AIAA Paper No.
 2006-1943, AIAA SDM Meeting, Newport, RI, May 2006, for an
 example of a STAGS model produced by STAGSUNIT. Stringer
 numbers increase with coordinate y; ring numbers increase
 with coordinate x.

 Do you want stringer(s) with a high nodal point density?=h

 The "nodal point density" referred to is with respect to
 the stringer cross section, not the density along the axis
 of the stringer. The density along the axis of the
 stringer is the same as the density along the x-coordinate
 in the panel skin.

 You may wamt one or more stringers with a higher nodal
 point density over the cross section than exists in the
 others, especially if there occurs local stress and/or
 buckling behavior not well represented by your previously
 specified nodal point distribution over the cross section
 used for all the stringers in your previous model.

 Do you want stringer(s) with a high nodal point density?=n
 n
 Do you want ring(s) with a high nodal point density?=n
 n

 You will next be asked if the material in the STAGS model
 can go plastic. For comparison with PANDA2 you will usually
 answer N (no). However, occasionally you may want to answer
 Y (yes). If you answer Y you will be asked to provide a
 stress-strain curve for the material and the number of
 integration points thru the wall thickness.

 NOTE: Answer Y only if the panel and stiffeners are all
       made of only one isotropic material. This "plasticity"
       option does not work for panels made of more than one
       material. The "plasticity" option WILL work provided
       that all the materials specified in BEGIN (*.BEG file)
       have the same isotropic properties.

 ANOTHER NOTE: The FIRST stress-strain coordinates you
               provide MUST agree with the elastic modulus
               you provided in BEGIN, that is,
               (first stress value)/(first strain value) = E

 Is there plasticity in this STAGS model?=n
 n
 Do you want to use the "least-squares" model for torque?=h

 Usually you should answer "y". In STAGSUNIT models, torque
 is always applied at x = 0. There are two choices:

 1. STAGSUNIT can simply apply the appropriate value of Nxy at
    x = 0 as one of the loading components in Shell Unit No. 1.

 2. STAGSUNIT can apply a torque about what the STAGS manual
    calls a "user-defined point". (This "user-defined point" is
    always located at the origin of the global coordinate system,
    (Xg,Yg,Zg)=(0,0,0) in STAGS models created via STAGSUNIT.)

 Given the choice of one of the two options, STAGSUNIT
 automatically generates the proper input data for STAGS.
 The user of STAGSUNIT does not need to worry about the
 details of the modeling.

 Option 2 is preferred because simple application of Nxy to the
 skin of the cylindrical shell at x = 0 generates, in nonlinear
 analyses, a small spurious hoop tension in a circumferential
 band of width approximately equal to a "boundary layer" width
 of about 2.0*SQRT(r*t) adjacent to x = 0. When you choose
 Option 2, STAGSUNIT automatically sets up a "user-defined" node
 at (Xg,Yg,Zg)=(0.,0.,0.) and sets up a finite element unit
 containing the torque, which is equal to Nxy*2*pi*r**2.

 Do you want to use the "least-squares" model for torque?=y
 y
 Is stiffener sidesway permitted at the panel edges?=h

 In the PANDA2 model it is assumed that stringer sidesway
 is permitted at the axially loaded ends of the panel,
 provided that the discretized skin-stringer module model is used.
 This is in order to obtain conservative designs. In STAGSMODEL
 and in STAGSUNIT you can choose whether or not this mode of
 deformation can occur.

 By "stiffener sidesway" is meant a mode of deformation in which
 the tip of the stiffener can deflect sideways (in the y-direction
 in Fig. 9 on p. 492 of the long PANDA2 paper in COMPUTERS AND
 STRUCTURES, 1987).

 In tests of panels "stringer sidesway" is usually prevented by
 friction at the axially loaded ends of the test specimen. In
 actual panels sidesway can occur if the stiffener tips or
 outstanding flanges are not attached to other structure.

 To simulate the PANDA2 model with use of IQUICK = 0, answer Y.
 If IQUICK = 1 in your PANDA2 model, then you should probably
 answer N.

 Is stiffener sidesway permitted at the panel edges?=n
 n
 Edges parallel to screen (0) in-plane deformable; (1) rigid=h

 This input is for the STAGS model of the panel generated via
 the command "STAGSUNIT".

 Choose 0 if you think the two edges of the panel that run
 parallel to the rings (panel width-wise coordinate direction
 or circumferential direction) ARE relatively free to deform
 in the x-direction, that is, in the axial direction in the
 plane of the panel skin.

 Choose 1 if you think these two edges of the panel ARE NOT
 free to deform in the x-direction.

 NOTE:  The projection of these two edges onto the surface of
        the undeformed panel are ALWAYS free to move in the
        x-direction as straight lines.

 Edges parallel to screen (0) in-plane deformable; (1) rigid=0
         0

 Next, you will be asked to provide an index, IBCX0XL, which
 controls the distribution of axial displacement u over the
 heights of the webs of the stringers at axial stations x=0
 and x=XSTAGS, which are the axial coordinates at the two
 axially loaded ends of the STAGS model of the panel.
 The index, IBCX0XL, is defined as follows:

 IBCX0XL=0: no constraint of u is imposed over each stringer
            web height in the STAGS model of the panel.

 IBCX0XL=1: u=constant is imposed over the height of each
            stringer web in the STAGS model of the panel.

 There is the following reason for the introduction of the
 index, IBCX0XL: The panel is designed to buckle locally at
 a load less than the design load, that is, the factor of
 safety for local buckling, FSLOC, is less than 0.9. We
 wish to simulate in the STAGS model the same end conditions
 that exist in the PANDA2 model for the precollapsed state
 of the locally postbuckled panel. By forcing the axial
 displacement u to be constant over the heights of the
 stringer webs, we prevent the overall axial bending of the
 stringer-stiffened panel that occurs because of the shift
 in the neutral axis caused by the axial softening of the
 panel skin as it deforms in its locally postbuckled state.

 If you have a panel loaded reasonably far into its locally
 postbuckled state at the design load, say FSLOC is less
 than about 0.7, and if the applied load is equal to the
 design load, and if the STAGS model represents a sub-domain
 of the panel analyzed or optimized by PANDA2 (that is,
 XSTAGS is less than the axial length of the panel optimized
 by PANDA2), then you should probably set IBCXOXL = 1  .
 Otherwise, set IBCX0XL = 0  .

 Stringer web axial displacement index, IBCX0XL=0 or 1=0

The cylstif.STG file can be used as is or edited and then used as input
in future executions of STAGSUNIT.

PART 3.8 STAGSUNIT produces two files, cylstif.bin and cylstif.inp,
         that are valid input files for the STAGS general-purpose
         finite-element computer program 

The PANDA2 processor, STAGSUNIT, has produced two files:

cylstif.bin
cylstif.inp

The STAGS file, cylstif.bin, is small, as follows:

PART 3.11 Compare with BIGBOSOR4 and PANDA2 predictions 
          of local buckling

It is seen that buckling occurs only near the
two ends of the cylindrical shell, and that the
buckling load factor is somewhat lower than those
predicted by BIGBOSOR4 and by PANDA2, as follows:

from BIGBOSOR4:

In the previous STAGS model the last two lines of the

    0    $ Edges parallel to screen (0) in-plane deformable; (1) rigid
    0    $ Stringer web axial displacement index, IBCX0XL=0 or 1


STAGS is run again as described above, and the following lines
now appear in the cylstif.out2 file:

In the previous STAGS model the lowest bifurcation buckling
eigenvalue was 1.030548E+00 (listed above in PART 3.9).
 
Compare the latest STAGS eigenvalue, 1.186805E+00, with

The latest buckling mode from STAGS is shown in the plot,

cylstif.stagsunit.eig1.rigidends.png

It is seen that this mode is no longer confined to
the ring bays nearest the two ends of the cylindrical
shell and that there is much better agreement with the
predictions from BIGBOSOR4 and PANDA2.

PART 3.13 Produce and run a different STAGS model, one
          with smeared stringers

Run a STAGS model again, this time with the use of
different input data in cylstif.STG. Now the stringers
are smeared out, and the last two entries are changed
back from 1 to 0. The new cylstif.STG file follows:

The latest buckling mode from STAGS is shown in the plot,

Because the rings are internal, the plot hides most of the
rings. We wish to obtain a plot of the same mode with the
skin with its smeared stringers removed so that we can see
the rings. The input data for STAPL in this particular is
as follows:

PART 3.16 Compare with the predictions from BIGBOSOR4
          and PANDA2

Compare the latest STAGS eigenvalue, 2.507291E+00, with
the eigenvalues that correspond to general buckling obtained
from BIGBOSOR4 and PANDA2:

General buckling load factor from BIGBOSOR4:

 BUCKLING LOADS FOLLOW

 **** CRITICAL EIGENVALUE AND WAVENUMBER ****
 EIGCRT=  2.8802E+00; NO. OF AXIAL HALF WAVES, NWVCRT=    1
 ****************************************************

The general buckling load factor obtained from BIGBOSOR4
is unconservative because BIGBOSOR4 does not account for
transverse shear defomation (t.s.d.).

 Buckling load factor BEFORE knockdown for smeared stringers=  2.4489E+00
 Buckling load factor AFTER  knockdown for smeared stringers=  2.2966E+00

 General buckling load factor before and after knockdown:
 EIGGEN(before modification by 5 factors below)     =  2.2966E+00
 Knockdown factor from modal imperfection(s)        =  1.0000E+00
 Knockdown factor for smearing rings on cyl. shell  =  9.0000E-01
 Knockup factor to avoid twice accounting for t.s.d.=  1.0000E+00
 1st modifying factor, FKNMOD=1 or 1/(EIG9X*FMDKD9) =  1.0000E+00
 2nd modifying factor, EIGMR9=1 or EIGGNX/EIGGEN    =  1.0000E+00
 After knockdn,EIGGEN*FKNOCK(9)*(RNGKNK/SHRFCT)*FKNMOD*EIGMR9=  2.0669E+00


The final general buckling load factor from PANDA2, 2.0669, is conservative
because the knockdown factors used in this case to compensate for the inherent 
un-conservatveness of smearing rings and stringers are conservative in PANDA2
models in which ICONSV=1 .

Here is how the PANDA2 margins for general buckling vary with the
"conservativeness" index, ICONSV, set equal to its three possible values
in the cylstif.OPT file:

MARGINS FOR CURRENT DESIGN: LOAD CASE NO. 1, SUBCASE NO. 1
MAR. MARGIN
NO.  VALUE                DEFINITION
ICONSV = 1:
14  8.24E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=3;slope=0.;FS=1.1
ICONSV = 0:
13  9.73E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=3;slope=0.;FS=1.1
ICONSV =-1:
13  1.19E+00 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=3;slope=0.;FS=1.1

ICONSV = 1, which is the recommended value, corresponds to the most
conservative PANDA2 model, and ICONSV = -1 corresponds to the least
conservative PANDA2 model.

The general buckling load factor is obtained from the general buckling
margin from the following:

(buckling load factor) = (factor of safety) x (margin + 1.0)

For the least conservative PANDA2 model (ICONSV = -1) the general
buckling load factor is given by

 (buckling load factor) = 1.1 x (1.19 + 1.0) = 2.409

This general buckling load factor from PANDA2 is fairly close
to that predicted by STAGS: 2.507.

PART 3.17 Produce and run a different STAGS model, one which
          covers only a small sub-domain of the entire shell,
          with all stiffener segments modeled as flexible
          shell units

Run a STAGS model yet again, this time with the use of
different input data in cylstif.STG. Now only a sub-domain of the
cylindrical shell is to be included in the STAGS model: a piece
of the cylindrical shell that contains 5 stringer bays and 3 ring
bays. There are rings along the two curved edges of the sub-domain,
and there are stringers along the two straight edges of the
sub-domain. These edge stiffeners have half the stiffness of the
interior stiffeners. The purpose of this STAGS model is to be able
to capture the local buckling load factor and mode shape with the 
use of a relatively dense mesh so that we have a converged prediction.

The critical buckling mode is shown in the plot:

The eigenvalue, 1.181702, is close to the eignvalue, 1.186805,
obtained from the STAGS model that includes the entire
cylindrical shell with both rings and stringers modeled
as flexible shell segments (shell units in STAGS jargon).
Compare the two plots:

cylstif.stagsunit.eig1.rigidends.png        (360-degree model)

There is very good agreement between STAGS, BIGBOSOR4, and PANDA2
for the prediction of local buckling.

PART 3.19 Compare with the PANDA2 prediction 

PANDA2 predicts the maximum effective stress as follows
from the list of margins for the perfect shell:

 MARGINS FOR CURRENT DESIGN: LOAD CASE NO. 1, SUBCASE NO. 1
 MAR. MARGIN
 NO.  VALUE                DEFINITION
 3  2.64E-01 eff.stress:matl=1,SKN,Dseg=2,node=6,layer=1,z=0.3845; MID.;FS=1.
 7  2.64E-01 eff.stress:matl=1,SKN,Iseg=2,at:n=6,layer=1,z=0.3845;-MID.;FS=1.

In the above "Dseg" means module segment number in the discretized model;
                    (The stress is computed in SUBROUTINE STRTHK).
             "Iseg" means module segment number in the "closed form" model;
                    (The stress is computed in SUBROUTINE STRCON).

Dseg = Iseg = 2 is, in this case, the base under the stringer.
node=6 and n=6 mean the sixth nodal point in Dseg and Iseg, respectively.
The sixth nodal point is the nodal point that lies in the panel skin
where the skin intersects the root of the stringer web.

The effective stress is found from the margin by the following:

(effective stress) = (allowable stress)/[(margin + 1.0) x (factor of safety)]
(effective stress) = (60000)/[(0.264 +1.0) x 1.0] = 47468 psi

STAGS predicts a maximum inner fiber effective stress of 51010 psi,
not far above the prediction from PANDA2.

The stress fringe plot is contained in the following file:

cylstif.stagsunit.outerfibstress.skin.zoom.png


STAGS predicts "outer" fiber effective stresses that are about the
same as the "inner" fiber effective stresses because there is not
much bending of the optimized stiffened shell. The maximum "outer"
fiber effective stress in the skin predicted by STAGS is 50250 psi
compared to 51010 psi for the maximum "inner" fiber effective stress
in the skin.

The STAGS model exhibits stress concentrations in the stringer webs
near the roots of the stringer webs. These stress concentrations
cannot be predicted by PANDA2, of course. In actual stiffened
cylindrical shells the wall thicknesses would be increased in the
immediate neighborhoods of the curved edges of the shell in order to
reduce possible local stress concentrations there. The very local
stress concentrations at the roots of three of the stringer webs
are displayed in the file:

cylstif.stagsunit.innerfibstress.webzoom.png

The maximum effective stress, 57860, occurs at the roots of the
stringer webs at the ends of the shell.

PART 3.21 Produce and run a different STAGS model, one which again
          covers only a small 6 x 3 bay sub-domain of the entire shell,
          with all ring segments modeled as flexible shell units
          and with the stringers smeared out

Next, use a new sub-domain model to determine from STAGS the lowest
buckling load factor that corresponds to inter-ring buckling.
In this sub-domain model the stringers are smeared out and the
rings are modeled with little flexible shell segments (shell units
in STAGS jargon). The STAGS model is generated by STAGSUNIT with
the following input data (cylstif.STG file):

It turns out that the lowest eigenvalue that corresponds primarily
to buckling of the skin-with-smeared-stringers between adjacent
rings is Eigenvalue no. 5. The buckling load factor is 2.035811.

----------------------------------

The eigenvalue, 2.035811, from STAGS that corresponds to inter-ring
buckling of skin plus smeared stringers agrees very well with those
from PANDA2 obtained before knockdown for compensating for the inherent
unconservativeness of smearing the stringers. As we shall see from the
next STAGS model, treating the stringers as flexible shell segments
(shell units in STAGS jargon) leads to an inter-ring buckling load
factor (eigenvalue) only about 6 per cent less than that from the
STAGS model in which the stringers are smeared. Therefore, in this
particular case, PANDA2 yields a conservative result when the
"conservativeness" index, ICONSV is set equal to unity.

The STAGS index, ILIN, is set equal to unity, that is:

         1      $ Nonlinear (0) or linear (1) kinematic relations?, ILIN

in order to filter out unwanted buckling eigenvalues that correspond
to local deformation of the stringers with little or no participation
the panel skin.

It is difficult to find the critical "inter-ring" buckling mode from
STAGS because that mode is "hidden" within a cluster of stringer
buckling modes.

The following is a series of STAGS runs, for which there are two
purposes:

1. Obtain the critical (lowest) buckling load factor for the sub-domain
   model with 6 x 3 bays with both T-stringers and T-rings modeled as
   flexible shell segments (shell units) and plot the mode shape.
   See the plot represented by the file, cylstif.stagsunit.6x3.eig1.png.
   This is local buckling, essentially the same buckling load factor and
   mode shape computed by PANDA2 (eigenvalue = 1.195; see the plot
   represented by the file, cylstif.localbuck.panel.png) and by BIGBOSOR4
   (eigenvalue = 1.21; see the plot represented by the same file,
   cylstif.localbuck.panel.png)

2. Search for and find the lowest buckling load factor and mode shape
   that correspond to inter-ring buckling, that is, a buckling mode
   shape that is analogous to that plotted for the 6 x 3 bay model
   in which the stringers are smeared. (See the plot in the file:
   cylstif.stagsunit.6x3.smrstr.eig5.png; eigenvalue=2.035.)
   The "inter-ring" buckling eigenvalue for the more elaborate STAGS
   model in which the stringers are modeled as flexible shell units
   was found. The mode shape is represented by the two files,
   cylstif.stagsunit.6x3.eig43.png and cylstif.stagsunit.6x3.eig43.skin.png;
   (43rd eigenvalue = 1.91). From STAGS we find that there is only a
   6 per cent decrease in the predicted buckling load factor for
   inter-ring buckling when we go from a model in which the stringers
   are smeared (eigenvalue = 2.035) to a model in which the stringers
   are modeled as flexible shell segments (eigenvalue = 1.91). Therefore,
   in this particular case PANDA2's prediction of inter-ring buckling
   is conservative when the "conservativeness" index, ICONSV = 1, which is
   the recommended value of ICONSV. The inter-ring buckling mode found
   from BIGBOSOR4 is represented by the file, cylstif.interring.panel2.png,
   and the corresponding buckling load factor from BIGBOSOR4 is 2.338.
   PANDA2 obtains an inter-ring buckling load factor of 2.03 before
   knockdown for smeared stringers and a bit more than half that after
   knockdown for smeared stringers when ICONSV = 1. (knockdown factor,
   SMRFAC=  5.7026E-01 when ICONSV = 1; SMRFAC = 1.0 when ICONSV = 0
   or -1).


The series of 16 STAGS runs that were required to find the inter-ring
buckling load factor and mode shape from STAGS are listed next. The
input datum, "eigenvalue shift", occurs near the end of the cylstif.bin
file. This input datum is changed before each of the STAGS runs is
executed. The fragments listed below are from the STAGS output files,
cylstif.out2. A column headed "ROOT" has been added in most cases.
That column is not included in the regular STAGS output.

The "inter-ring" buckling mode is found after many successive executions
of STAGS in which the eigenvalue shift is changed from execution to
execution.

Plots of the inter-ring buckling mode with associated eigenvalue are
contained in the two files:

cylstif.stagsunit.6x3.eig43.png
cylstif.stagsunit.6x3.eig43.skin.png

What is called here the "inter-ring buckling mode" is a mode in
which the stringers bend in the axial direction between rings along
with the skin, and there are nodal lines in the skin deformation
at the axial stations where the web roots of the rings intersect
the skin. This 43rd buckling mode is analogous to that from STAGS
depicted in the file, cylstif.stagsunit.6x3.smrstr.eig5.png
(buckling load factor, eigenvalue=2.035), and that from
BIGBOSOR4 depicted in the file, cylstif.interring.panel2.png
(buckling load factor, eigenvalue=2.338). The inter-ring buckling
load factor from BIGBOSOR4 (2.338) is higher than that from STAGS
(2.035) mainly because BIGBOSOR4 does not handle the effects of
transverse shear deformation (t.s.d.) and the STAGS 480 finite
element does.
