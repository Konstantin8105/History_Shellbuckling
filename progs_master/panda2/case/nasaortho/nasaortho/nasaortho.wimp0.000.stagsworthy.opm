 The numbers of the references [ ] given in the CHAPTER
 headings correspond to those listed at the end of the paper:
 Bushnell, D.
 "Optimization of an axially compressed ring and stringer
 stiffened cylindrical shell with a general buckling modal
 imperfection", AIAA Paper 2007-2216, 48th AIAA SDM Meeting,
 Honolulu, Hawaii, April 2007

 The overall structure of PANDA2 and its use are described in
 the first PANDA2 paper, Ref.[1A], cited in the April 2007
 paper just identified. Ref.[1A] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "PANDA2 - Program for minimum weight design of stiffened,
 composite, locally buckled panels", COMPUTERS AND STRUCTURES,
 Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987

 Concepts such as "wide-column" buckling, "discretized module
 model", "stringer pop-off", "constitutive matrices"
 "reduction factor for transverse shear deformtion (t.s.d.)"
 "smeared stiffeners", "neutral surface", "overall and local
 static response to uniform pressure", "knockdown factors for
 anisotropy and in-plane shear loading", "crippling of
 stiffener parts", and "local postbuckling" are described
 there, with many early PANDA2 examples provided.

 The string, "PANDA-type theory" often occurs. This refers to
 the theory presented in Ref. [1B] of the April 2007 citation
 listed first. Ref.[1B] contains the theory given in the paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Theoretical basis of the PANDA computer program for
 preliminary design of stiffened panels under combined in-
 plane loads", COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES, v. 27, No. 4,
 pp 541-563 (1987).

 The theory used for local postbuckling behavior appears in
 Ref. [1C] of the April 2007 paper cited first (above).
 Ref. [1C] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
 under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
 regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
 Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114

 The theory used for imperfection sensitivity appears in
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] of the first-cited paper above.
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] are the following two papers:

 "Recent enhancements to PANDA2" AIAA Paper 96-1337-CP,
 Proc. of the AIAA 37th Structures, Structural Dynamics and
 Materials Conference, pp 126-182, April, 1996.

 The last paper cited also describes the "global" optimizer,
 "SUPEROPT", implementation of Sanders shell equations into
 PANDA2, implementation of the Arbocz theory for imperfection
 sensitivity, implementation of isogrid geometry, and
 implementation of various truss-core geometries, with examples.

 The theories used in PANDA2 for the analysis of sandwich
 walls are given in Ref.[1F] of the first-cited paper above.

 honeycomb or foam cores", AIAA Paper 97-1142, Proc. 38th AIAA
 Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference,
 pp 2163-2202, April, 1997

 The "alternate" (double-trigonometric series expansion
 buckling theory) and the discretized "skin"-ring module
 model are described in Ref. [1G] of the first-cited paper.
 Ref. [1G] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D., Jiang, H., and Knight, N.F.,
 "Additional buckling solutions in PANDA2", Proceedings of the
 40th AIAA SDM Conference, AIAA Paper 99-1233, pp 302-345

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

***** BEGIN SUBROUTINE KOIT2 (KOITER THEORY POSTBUCKLING) ****

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  4
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  6.65E-03
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.90E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  1.36E+00
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.34E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.35E+00
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 Margin=  3.5758E-01  Bending-torsion buckling: Koiter theory,M=4   axial halfwav;FS=0.999            

 Prediction of amplitude "f" (Eq.(24),p54,CMAME 1993)
 of local deformation of discretized skin-stringer module from
 pre-calculation assumption that f = [EKOITR/(EKOITR-1) -1]*W0:
                        f = [EKOITR/(EKOITR-1) -1]*W0 =  1.3914E-05
 in which EKOITR is the bifurcation buckling load factor from
 KOITER-type theory and W0 is the amplitude of the initial
 buckling modal imperfection:                      W0 =  4.9565E-06
 Factor by which "f" is to be multiplied to compensate for the
 prediction that the bifurcation buckling load factor from
 BOSOR4-type theory is smaller than that from KOITER theory:
 FMULT = [EBOSOR/(EBOSOR-1.)-1]/[EKOITR/(EKOITR-1.)-1]=  1.0000E+00
 FMULT, which is not permitted to be smaller than unity, is
 used primarily to compensate for the fact that transverse
 shear deformation effects are not properly  accounted for in
 the KOITER branch of PANDA2.

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  4
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  6.76E-03
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.90E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  1.38E+00
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.37E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.38E+00
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 Margin=  3.7787E-01  Bending-torsion buckling: Koiter theory,M=4   axial halfwav;FS=0.999            

 Prediction of amplitude "f" (Eq.(24),p54,CMAME 1993)
 of local deformation of discretized skin-stringer module from
 pre-calculation assumption that f = [EKOITR/(EKOITR-1) -1]*W0:
                        f = [EKOITR/(EKOITR-1) -1]*W0 =  1.3165E-05
 in which EKOITR is the bifurcation buckling load factor from
 KOITER-type theory and W0 is the amplitude of the initial
 buckling modal imperfection:                      W0 =  4.9565E-06
 Factor by which "f" is to be multiplied to compensate for the
 prediction that the bifurcation buckling load factor from
 BOSOR4-type theory is smaller than that from KOITER theory:
 FMULT = [EBOSOR/(EBOSOR-1.)-1]/[EKOITR/(EKOITR-1.)-1]=  1.0000E+00
 FMULT, which is not permitted to be smaller than unity, is
 used primarily to compensate for the fact that transverse
 shear deformation effects are not properly  accounted for in
 the KOITER branch of PANDA2.

 THERE IS SOME POSITIVE MARGIN FOR GENERAL INSTABILITY AND THE
 STRINGER SPACING IS NOT AT ITS LOWER BOUND.  IF YOU HAVE RUN
 PANDAOPT MANY TIMES IN SUCCESSION IN ORDER TO GET AN OPTIMUM
 DESIGN, YOU MAY BE NEAR A LOCAL OPTIMUM BUT MAYBE NOT A GLOBAL
 OPTIMUM. USE "CHANGE" TO RESET THE STRINGER SPACING b TO A
 SMALLER VALUE.  ALSO, POSSIBLY USE "DECIDE" TO RESET THE
 LOWER BOUND OF THE STRINGER SPACING b TO A SMALLER VALUE.
 THEN PERFORM MORE "PANDAOPTs".

 *** NOTE 1: IT IS OFTEN A GOOD IDEA NOT TO HAVE THE STRINGER
           SPACING AS A DECISION VARIABLE, BUT TO PERFORM
           OPTIMIZATIONS FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT FIXED STRINGER
           SPACINGS.

 *** NOTE 2: IF THE PANEL IS IMPERFECT OR HAS LOW STRESS ALLOW-
           IT IS LIKELY THAT AT THE GLOBAL OPTIMUM DESIGN THE
           GENERAL AND/OR INTER-RING BUCKLING LOAD MARGINS ARE
           NOT CRITICAL. THEN PLEASE DISREGARD THIS WARNING.
