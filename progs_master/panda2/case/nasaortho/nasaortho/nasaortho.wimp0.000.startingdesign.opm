 "Optimization of an axially compressed ring and stringer
 stiffened cylindrical shell with a general buckling modal
 imperfection", AIAA Paper 2007-2216, 48th AIAA SDM Meeting,
 Honolulu, Hawaii, April 2007

 The overall structure of PANDA2 and its use are described in
 the first PANDA2 paper, Ref.[1A], cited in the April 2007
 paper just identified. Ref.[1A] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "PANDA2 - Program for minimum weight design of stiffened,
 composite, locally buckled panels", COMPUTERS AND STRUCTURES,
 Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987

 Concepts such as "wide-column" buckling, "discretized module
 model", "stringer pop-off", "constitutive matrices"
 "reduction factor for transverse shear deformtion (t.s.d.)"
 "smeared stiffeners", "neutral surface", "overall and local
 static response to uniform pressure", "knockdown factors for
 anisotropy and in-plane shear loading", "crippling of
 stiffener parts", and "local postbuckling" are described
 there, with many early PANDA2 examples provided.

 The string, "PANDA-type theory" often occurs. This refers to
 the theory presented in Ref. [1B] of the April 2007 citation
 listed first. Ref.[1B] contains the theory given in the paper:

 "Theoretical basis of the PANDA computer program for
 preliminary design of stiffened panels under combined in-
 plane loads", COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES, v. 27, No. 4,
 pp 541-563 (1987).

 PANDA2, implementation of the Arbocz theory for imperfection
 sensitivity, implementation of isogrid geometry, and
 implementation of various truss-core geometries, with examples.

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.22E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.23E+00
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 Prediction of amplitude "f" (Eq.(24),p54,CMAME 1993)
 of local deformation of discretized skin-stringer module from
 pre-calculation assumption that f = [EKOITR/(EKOITR-1) -1]*W0:
                        f = [EKOITR/(EKOITR-1) -1]*W0 =  4.3912E-05
 in which EKOITR is the bifurcation buckling load factor from
 KOITER-type theory and W0 is the amplitude of the initial
 buckling modal imperfection:                      W0 =  1.0000E-05
 Factor by which "f" is to be multiplied to compensate for the
 prediction that the bifurcation buckling load factor from
 BOSOR4-type theory is smaller than that from KOITER theory:
 FMULT = [EBOSOR/(EBOSOR-1.)-1]/[EKOITR/(EKOITR-1.)-1]=  1.0000E+00
 FMULT, which is not permitted to be smaller than unity, is
 used primarily to compensate for the fact that transverse
 shear deformation effects are not properly  accounted for in
 the KOITER branch of PANDA2.

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  1
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  2.78E-03
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.93E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  1.22E+00
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.22E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.23E+00
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 Margin=  2.2491E-01  Local buckling from Koiter theory,M=1   axial halfwaves;FS=0.999                

 Prediction of amplitude "f" (Eq.(24),p54,CMAME 1993)
 of local deformation of discretized skin-stringer module from
 pre-calculation assumption that f = [EKOITR/(EKOITR-1) -1]*W0:
                        f = [EKOITR/(EKOITR-1) -1]*W0 =  4.4706E-05
 in which EKOITR is the bifurcation buckling load factor from
 KOITER-type theory and W0 is the amplitude of the initial
 buckling modal imperfection:                      W0 =  1.0000E-05
 Factor by which "f" is to be multiplied to compensate for the
 prediction that the bifurcation buckling load factor from
 BOSOR4-type theory is smaller than that from KOITER theory:
 FMULT = [EBOSOR/(EBOSOR-1.)-1]/[EKOITR/(EKOITR-1.)-1]=  1.0000E+00
 FMULT, which is not permitted to be smaller than unity, is
 used primarily to compensate for the fact that transverse
 shear deformation effects are not properly  accounted for in
 the KOITER branch of PANDA2.

 Inter-ring buckling with smeared stringers and ring rolling
 is not recorded as a margin because this type of buckling
 has been superseded by the results from the discretized
 inter-ring module model, for which inter-ring buckling
 load factors have been computed in the range from n =     1
 to n =    75 circumferential halfwaves.
 The critical inter-ring-buckling-with-ring-rolling model has   16
 circ. half waves, which lies within this range.
