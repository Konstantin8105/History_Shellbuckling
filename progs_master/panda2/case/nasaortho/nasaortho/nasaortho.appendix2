DETAILS FROM A PANDA2 EXECUTION OF PANDAOPT WITH THE OPTIMIZED
DESIGN LISTED IN TABLE 33a. This appendix shows what calculations
PANDA2 performs for a "fixed" design (not optimization). Additional 
discussion complements the output produced in the nasaortho.OPM
file.
=====================================================================

**********************************************************************
**********************************************************************
**********************************************************************
Begin a rather long discussion of PANDA2 results that lead to Table 33a.

For extensive detail about what PANDA2 does during all the computations
associated with Load Case 1, Subcase 1 in connection with
the optimum design of the imperfect shell, please inspect the 
following file:

...panda2/doc/panda2chapters.pdf

Most of the file, ...panda2/doc/panda2chapters.pdf, is repeated here
for the convenience of the reader. Discussion is added to various
sections in this long list.

Only a very short summary of the nasaortho.OPM file is presented in
Table 33a.

In PANDA2 the "reporting" (listing results in the nasaortho.OPM file)
from the computations is divided into 28 chapters (called "CHAPTER"s
in the *.OPM output file generated by execution of PANDAOPT). These
CHAPTERs are as follows:

 ENTERING SUBROUTINE STRUCT
 ****************    TABLE OF CONTENTS   *********************
 CHAPTER 1  Compute the 6 x 6 constitutive matrices [C] for
            individual model segments and various combinations
            thereof (skin with smeared stiffener sets [1A]).
 CHAPTER 2  Do PANDA-type [1B] general buckling analysis to
            get Donnell factors for later use, if appropriate.
 CHAPTER 3  Do various PANDA-type [1B] general buckling
            analyses needed for later computation of effective
            length of the panel. Compute the effective length.

 CHAPTER NEW Compute wide-column buckling from discretized
            skin-stringer module model (Figs. 20b,c & 22b,c in
            [1A]) with only Nx (Ny=0, Nxy=0). The purpose is to
            obtain a knockdown factor, WIDKNK, for smearing
            the stringers in an inter-ring buckling mode
 CHAPTER 4  Compute axisymmetric prebuckling "hungry-horse"
            state of the curved panel or cylindrical shell.
            (See Ref.[1E]).
 CHAPTER 5  Get static response of panel to normal pressure
            [1A].
 CHAPTER 6  Do PANDA-type [1B] general and inter-ring buckling
            analyses to permit later computation of
            amplification of panel bowing.
 CHAPTER 7  Compute distribution of loads in panel module
            skin-stringer segments, neglecting redistribution
            due to initial buckling modal imperfections
            (See Section 10 of [1A]).
 CHAPTER 8  Do PANDA-type local, inter-ring, general buckling
            analyses and PANDA-type stringer web and ring web
            buckling analyses to get knockdown factors to
            compensate for lack of in-plane shear Nxy loading
            and anisotropy in discretized BOSOR4-type models.
            (See Section 11 of [1A] and Item No. 81 in [1L]).
 CHAPTER 9  Do BOSOR4-type "skin"-ring buckling analyses to
            compute knockdown factor to compensate for

            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

The following long discussion covers most of these computations.
Most of the following PANDA2 output corresponds to Load Set 1, Subcase 1,
Wimp = +0.125 inch. There is a section concerning CHAPTERs 13 and 14 for
which output from CHAPTERs 13 and 14 is listed first for Load Set 1,
then for Load Set 2. These two sections are listed one right after the
other, which is not the order in which the computations are performed
in PANDA2. In PANDA2 ALL Load set 1 computations are performed first,
followed by ALL Load Set 2 computations.

Some of the output in the following list is obtained with the print
index, NPRINT, set equal to 0 in the nasaortho.OPM file. Other output
is obtained with NPRINT = 2.

In particular, see the section in that paper entitled, "Introduction

From CHAPTER 10.1: PANDA2 determines prebuckling bending of the shell
with the general buckling modal imperfection (printed in the *.OPM
file when NPRINT = 2 in the *.OPT file.

The sign conventions used in PANDA2 are described in Section 7.2 on
pages 492 and 493 of the original long PANDA2 paper:

 [1] Bushnell, D.,
 "PANDA2 - Program for minimum weight design of stiffened,
  composite, locally buckled panels", COMPUTERS AND STRUCTURES,
  Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987

Positive normal deflection w of the panel skin (w is called "WAMP" above)
is such that the panel bends in the axial direction so as to
put the panel skin in more axial tension than the tips of the stringers.
(See Fig. 9 on p. 492 of the paper just cited). That is, positive w is
in the same sense as positive z in Fig 9 of [1]. Positive axial curvature
change, Wxx9, is in the sense that causes more compression in the panel
skin than at the tips of the stringers.

Details about how the PANDA2 results listed below are obtained
are given in the papers,

To quote from a more recent paper,

 [18] Bushnell, D.
 "Optimization of an axially compressed ring and stringer
 stiffened cylindrical shell with a general buckling modal
 imperfection", AIAA Paper 2007-2216, 48th AIAA SDM Meeting,
 Honolulu, Hawaii, April 2007

the general buckling modal imperfection has two important effects:

"A general buckling modal imperfection in a stiffened shell has two major effects:

1. The imperfect stiffened panel or shell bends as soon as any loading is applied.
This prebuckling bending causes significant redistribution of stresses between the
panel skin and the various stiffener parts, thus affecting significantly many local
and inter-ring buckling and stress constraints (margins).

2. The "effective" circumferential curvature of an imperfect cylindrical panel or
shell depends on the amplitude of the initial imperfection, on the circumferential
wavelength of the critical buckling mode of the perfect and of the imperfect shell,
and on the amount that the initial imperfection grows as the loading increases from
zero to the design load. The "effective" circumferential radius of curvature of the
imperfect and loaded cylindrical shell is larger than its nominal radius of
curvature because the larger "effective" radius corresponds to the maximum local
radius of the cylindrical shell with a typical inward circumferential lobe of the
initial and subsequently load-amplified buckling modal imperfection. In PANDA2 this
larger local "effective" radius of curvature is assumed to be the governing UNIFORM
radius in the buckling equations pertaining to the imperfect shell. For the purpose
of computing the general buckling load, the imperfect shell is replaced by a new
perfect cylindrical shell with the larger "effective" circumferential radius.
By means of this device a complicated nonlinear collapse analysis is converted into
a simple approximate bifurcation buckling problem - a linear eigenvalue problem.
For each type of buckling modal imperfection (general, inter-ring, local [1E])
PANDA2 computes a "knockdown" factor based on the ratio:

(buckling load factor: panel with its "effective" circumferential radius)/     (7.1)
(buckling load factor: panel with its nominal circumferential radius)"

Note that PANDA2 predicts that the normal deflection caused by prebuckling bending
of the globally imperfect shell under the uniform axial compression,
Nx = -2219 lb/in (the design load), is:

Amplitude of prebuckling bending due to loading, WAMP=WIMP/(EIGEFF-1.)=  1.5570E-01 inch

as listed above. The approximate theory used in PANDA2 that leads to this result
does not predict different amplitudes for inward and outward deflection. From
Fig. 51 we see that STAGS predicts different outward and inward maximum normal
deflections w for the shell subjected to the design load, load factor PA = 1.0
(Nx = -2219 lb/in). This difference leads to different predictions of the behavior
of the imperfect shell from STAGS and from PANDA2, STAGS, of course, being regarded
as yielding the more accurate prediction. This is one of the reasons that the
PANDA2 user should ALWAYS evaluate an optimum design obtained by PANDA2 by using
a general-purpose computer program such as STAGS.

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   1.0000E+00                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

********* CHAPTERS 13 and 14 in the nasaortho.OPM file ************
From CHAPTERS 13 and 14 (single discretized skin-stringer module model):
For more information about the "single discretized skin-stringer module
model", see the paper:

 [1] Bushnell, D.,
 "PANDA2 - Program for minimum weight design of stiffened,
  composite, locally buckled panels", COMPUTERS AND STRUCTURES,
  Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987

See Figs. 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20, 46, 80, and 90a from that paper
for examples of single skin-stringer modules.

Note that in Table 33b Margins 4 and 8, "Eff.stress:matl=1", are
equal to eachother, whereas in Table 33a the corresponding margins,
Margins 4 and 9 near the top of p. 1 of Table 33a differ by more
than a factor of two. Margin no. 4 is computed with SUBROUTINE
STRTHK whereas the other stress margin (Margin 9 in Table 33a and
Margin 8 in Table 33b) is computed with SUBROUTINE STRCON.
SUBROUTINE STRTHK accounts for any local deformation computed
in the KOITER branch (CHAPTER 16), and THE VALUE OF THE MARGIN DEPENDS
ON THE SIGN OF THE INITIAL GENERAL BUCKLING MODAL IMPERFECTION.
In contrast SUBROUTINE STRCON does not include the local deformation
computed in the KOITER branch of PANDA2, and both plus and minus
versions of the general buckling modal imperfection are processed
for each load case during the determination of the maximum effective stress.
Notice that on the upper portion of page 2 of Table 33a Margin 4 is 1.19
compared to 2.54 on the upper portion of page 1 of Table 33a. THE DIFFERENCE
IS CAUSED BY THE SIGN OF THE GENERAL BUCKLING MODAL IMPERFECTION:
positive in the first load case and negative in the second load case. 

Again referring to Table 33a. The lowest (most critical) stress margins
are Margins 6 and 10 in the upper part on p. 1 of Table 33a:
"eff.stress:matl=2,STR". Margin 6 = "eff.stress:matl=2,STR,Dseg=3,node=11";
Margin 10 = "eff.stress:matl=2,STR,Iseg=3,at:TIP". In the single module
model Dseg = 3 and Iseg = 3 means "Segment 3", which is the stringer web.
Node 11 in Dseg=3 is the tip of the stringer. The high stress at the tip
of the stringer in Load Case 1 arises because the imperfect shell is
bending under the axial load in such a way that the tips of the stringers
are compressed more than their roots. The distribution of axial resultant
Nx across the height of a stringer from root to tip is given, for a POSITIVE 
imperfection amplitude, Wimp = +0.125 inch (Load Case 1), by the following:
 PREBUCKLING AXIAL RESULTANTS IN STRINGER WEB: SEGMENT NO.  3
  "Eigenvalue" axial resultant, Nx(var)=
 -1.3716E+03 -1.6731E+03 -1.9745E+03 -2.2760E+03 -2.5774E+03 -2.8789E+03
 -3.1803E+03 -3.4818E+03 -3.7832E+03 -4.0847E+03 -4.3861E+03
This output appears for Load Case 1, Subcase 1 in CHAPTER 13 of the
nasaortho.OPM file from PANDA2. The stress margin corresponding to this is
given in the upper portion of page 1 of Table 33a:
Margin 6 = 0.273, "eff.stress:matl=2,STR,Dseg=3,node=11"
Node 11 is at the tip of the stringer. For Load Case 2, Subcase 1, that is,
for a NEGATIVE imperfection amplitude, Wimp = -0.125 inch, the distribution
of axial resultant Nx across the height of a stringer from root to tip is
given in CHAPTER 13 of nasaortho.OPM by the following:
 PREBUCKLING AXIAL RESULTANTS IN STRINGER WEB: SEGMENT NO.  3
  "Eigenvalue" axial resultant, Nx(var)=
 -2.6162E+03 -2.3322E+03 -2.0482E+03 -1.7642E+03 -1.4802E+03 -1.1962E+03
 -9.1215E+02 -6.2814E+02 -3.4412E+02 -6.0108E+01  2.2391E+02
The corresponding stress margin for the NEGATIVE imperfection appears in
the upper part of page 2 of Table 33a:
Margin 6 = 1.26, "eff.stress:matl=2,STR,Dseg=3,node=1"
Node 1 is at the root of the stringer.
Note that, unlike Margin 6, which is the margin computed from SUBROUTINE
STRTHK and which depends on the sign of the general buckling modal
imperfection, The "other" matl=2 (stringer material) stringer stress
margin, "eff.stress:matl=2,STR,Iseg=3,at:TIP", that is, Margin no. 10
in Load case 1, Subcase 1 and Margin no. 11 in Load Case 2, Subcase 1,
is equal to 0.287 for both load cases. This is because the stresses
computed in SUBROUTINE STRCON compute the highest stress from either
positive or negative amplitudes of the general buckling modal imperfection.

In this particular case (because there is very little local "post-buckling"
(CHAPTER 16 in nasaortho.OPM) and because the inter-ring axisymmetric "hungry horse"
deformation if very small (CHAPTER 4 in nasaortho.OPM with NPRINT=2) the
stringer stress is almost entirely caused by the applied axial compression
and the "global" prebuckling bending of the shell with the general
buckling modal imperfection. For the POSITIVE imperfection (Load Case 1,
Subcase 1) the stress computed from the largest Nx is:

stress = Nx/(web thickness) = -4386.1/0.080641 = -54390 psi. The margin
corresponding to this stress is given by:

 margin = (allowable stress)/(effective stress x f.s.) - 1.0
        =              70000/(54390 x 0.999) - 1.0          = 0.288

Notice that 0.288 agrees almost exactly with Margin No. 10 in the upper part
of page 1 of Table 33a and with Margin No. 11 in the upper part of page 2.
For the NEGATIVE imperfection (Load Case 2, Subcase 1) the stress computed
from the largest Nx is:

stress = Nx/(web thickness) = -2616.2/0.080641 = -32443 psi. The margin
corresponding to this stress is given by:

 margin = (allowable stress)/(effective stress x f.s.) - 1.0
        =             70000/(32443 x 0.999)  - 1.0          = 1.160 

The difference between 0.288 and Margin no. 6 = 0.273 in the upper part
of page 1 of Table 33a and the difference between 1.160 and
Margin no. 6 = 1.26 in the upper part of page 2 of Table 33a are
caused by the slight amount of local bending in the stringer that is
computed in the Koiter branch (CHAPTER 16) of PANDA2.

More information relating to Table 33a...
The amount of "global" prebuckling bending of the shell with the
general buckling modal imperfection depends on what is used for
the "conservativeness index", ICONSV, in the PANDA2 input file
for MAINSETUP, nasaortho.OPT. The "conservative index" is described
in the paper:

 Bushnell, D.,
"Optimization of an axially compressed ring and stringer stiffened
 cylindrical shell with a general buckling modal imperfection",
 AIAA Paper 2007-2216, 48th AIAA SDM Meeting, Honolulu, Hawaii,
 April 2007.

and in the following items of the file, .../panda2/doc/panda2.news:
Items 676, 690, 694, 707, 713, 725, 741, 754, 764, 767, 768.
The amount of prebuckling bending of the globally imperfect shell
depends on ICONSV because various knockdown factors used to compensate
for the approximate nature of the theories used in PANDA2 depend on
ICONSV. (See Table 23 for knockdown factors for ICONSV = 1 and see
Tables 69 and 70 for the dependence of them and margins on ICONSV). The following
list presents the prebuckling distributions of Nx in the stringer web
(SEGMENT NO. 3) and the related stress margins for positive and negative
amplitudes of the general buckling modal imperfection (Wimp = + & - 0.125 inch).


ICONSV = 1 (leads to the most conservative designs and is the preferred value):

Note that there is a strong dependence of the effective stress margin on
which value is used for ICONSV. The most conservative model, ICONSV = 1,
(which is the recommended model in PANDA2) yields the lowest stress
margins and the least conservative model, ICONSV = -1, yields the highest
stress margins.

Still more information relating to Table 33a...
In computing the local buckling load factor from the single discretized
skin-stringer module model, PANDA2 makes certain adjustments to the
prebuckling load distribution over the module cross section in order
to ensure that PANDA2 will not obtain unconservative designs. In this
case in Load Case 1, Subcase 1 (POSITIVE general buckling modal imperfection
amplitude, Wimp = +0.125 inch) the margins associated with various
types of local buckling are:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MARGINS FOR CURRENT DESIGN: LOAD CASE NO. 1, SUBCASE NO. 1
 MAR. MARGIN
 NO.  VALUE                DEFINITION
 1  4.98E-02 Local buckling from discrete model-1.,M=4   axial halfwaves;FS=0.99
 2  4.47E-02 Bending-torsion buckling; M=4  ;FS=0.999
 3  3.87E-02 Bending-torsion buckling: Koiter theory,M=4   axial halfwav;FS=0.99
 7  1.76E-01 (m=4   lateral-torsional buckling load factor)/(FS)-1;FS=0.999
12  1.45E-02 buckling margin stringer Iseg.3 . Local halfwaves=5  .MID.;FS=1.
13 -8.20E-03 buckling margin stringer Iseg.3 . Local halfwaves=5  .NOPO;FS=1.
16  6.79E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=45;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first 4 margins (1,2,3,7) represent the same phenomenon with slightly
different approximations: buckling of the discretized skin-stringer single
module model. The next two margins (12 and 13) are derived from closed-form
solutions in which the stringer, assumed to be simply supported at its root,
buckles with the same number of axial halfwaves that PANDA2 finds that is
critical for the skin when a closed-form solution is used for skin buckling.
The last local buckling margin (16) is derived from a closed-form solution
in which the stringer web bends from root to tip. The most accurate model
is the discretized skin-stringer single module model (Margins 1 and 2). In
this case the POSITIVE general buckling modal imperfection is such that
prebuckling bending lessens the axial compression in the skin and increases
the compression at the tip of the stringer. In order to avoid obtaining
unconservative designs, PANDA2, omits the lessening of the axial compression
in the skin in Segments 1 and 4 of the single module cross section. When
this strategy is taken PANDA2 writes rather long notes to the *.OPM file
when the print index, NPRINT = 2. These notes follow:

 This is Segment 1 (Panel skin between adjacent stringers)
 Because of "effective width" considerations, the incremental
 AXIAL tension in the panel skin, which is generated by
 prebuckling bending of the imperfect panel, is being reset to
 zero for the buckling computations (ONLY in Segs.1 and NSEG).
 This is done because in the real world the incremental axial
 tension in the panel skin decays from its computed value at
 the hoop coordinate corresponding to the stringer station to
 nearly zero midway between adjacent stringers. Therefore, it
 is conservative to neglect the effect of this axial tension
 on the local buckling load factor computed from the discrete
 skin-stringer module. Axial tension is retained in Segment 2.

Corresponding to Load Case 2, Subcase 2, for which the general buckling
modal imperfection is NEGATIVE, Wimp = -0.125 inch, the two notes about
setting dNx and dNy equal to zero do not occur because the shape of the
negative imperfection is such as to cause additional compression in the
panel skin as the axial load is applied to the imperfect shell. The

***** BEGIN SUBROUTINE KOIT2 (KOITER THEORY POSTBUCKLING) ****

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  4
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  5.03E-03
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.93E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  1.04E+00
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.04E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.05E+00
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.
