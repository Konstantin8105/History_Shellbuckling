ABSTRACT

The capability of the computer program PANDA2 to generate minimum-weight designs
of stiffened panels and cylindrical shells is enhanced to permit the
adding of substiffeners with rectangular cross sections between adjacent major
stringers and rings. As a result many new buckling margins exist that
govern buckling over various domains and subdomains of the doubly stiffened
panel or shell. These generally influence the evolution of the design during
optimization cycles. The substiffeners may be stringers and/or rings or may
form an isogrid pattern. The effects of local, inter-ring, and general buckling
modal imperfections can be accounted for during optimization. Perfect and
imperfect cylindrical shells with external T-shaped stringers and T-shaped 
rings and with and without substringers and subrings and under combined
axial compression, external pressure, and in-plane shear are optimized
by multiple executions of a "global" optimizer called SUPEROPT. It is found 
that from the point of view of minimum weight there is little advantage of
adding substiffeners. However, with substiffeners present the major stringers
and rings are spaced farther apart at the optimum design than is so when there
are no substiffeners. The weight of a cylindrical shell with substiffeners is much
less sensitive to the spacing of the major T-shaped stringers than is the case
for a cylindrical shell without substiffeners. The optimum designs obtained
by PANDA2 are evaluated by comparisons with buckling loads obtained from a
general-purpose finite element program called STAGS. Predictions from STAGS
agree well with those from PANDA2. 


INTRODUCTION

Local and overall buckling and optimization of panels can be determined 
with the PANDA2 [1], POSTOP [2], VICONOPT [3], and PASCO [4] computer 
programs. These four programs are capable of obtaining optimum designs, 
and PANDA2, POSTOP, and VICONOPT can do so including the effect of 
local postbuckling of the panel skin and/or parts of the stringers.

Other contributions to the field of buckling and postbuckling
of panels include works by Weaver and his colleagues [5-7], Hilburger, 
et al[8], Baruch and Singer [9], the creators of the STAGS general 
purpose program, Almroth, Rankin, Brogan, and Riks [10-12], Arbocz and 
his colleagues [13-15], Stein [16], Leissa [17], Arnold and Parekh
[18], Starnes, Knight, and Rouse [19], Spier [20,21], Khot and Bauld
[22,23], Zhang and Matthews [24], Gurdal and his colleagues [25-30],
Haftka and his colleagues [30-32], Librescu and his colleagues [33-35],
Sridharan and his colleagues [36,37], Myers and Hyer [38], Nemeth [39],
and Noor, Starnes, and Peters [40], to identify but a few in a vast 
literature.


PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER

The purpose of this paper is to report on an enhancement to PANDA2 that 
permits the optimization of flat and/or cylindrical panels and shells 
with the "usual" stringers and rings and also with "substiffeners". 
That is, the skin between the "usual" stringers and rings can be 
further stiffened by additional members, called "substiffeners" in this 
work. The substiffeners must be of rectangular cross section. The 
"usual" stiffeners (stringers and rings) can, as always, have a variety 
of cross sections, such as rectangular, Tee, Jay, Zee, Hat, Truss-Core, 
as described in [1]. The new version of PANDA2 is used to find minimum 
weight designs of cylindrical shells with T-shaped stringers and 
T-shaped rings and with rectangular substringers and subrings. Figure 1
shows a STAGS model of a piece of a cylindrical shell with major T-shaped stringers,
major T-shaped rings and rectangular (blade) substringers and subrings.

Thermal loading is not included in cases that involve substiffeners. 
Also, local postbuckling is not permitted in such cases. The objective 
of this research is to determine if the minimum-weight designs of 
cylindrical shells with the more complex "double" stiffening scheme are 
significantly lighter than those optimized with just T-shaped stringers 
and T-shaped rings.

The substiffeners can also form an isogrid pattern between major axial
stiffeners (stringers) and circumferential major stiffeners (rings).
If the major stiffeners form an isogrid there cannot be any substiffeners. If there
are substiffeners present, there can be no post-local buckling analysis (no "Koiter"
analysis,[1,45]). There are no discretized single module models of a segment of
panel skin with one substiffener, as with the major stiffeners [1]. In the skin-stringer
and skin-ring discretized modules, the substiffeners are smeared out in the manner
of Baruch and Singer [9]. Hence, in these discretized module models the new
panel "skin" between major stiffeners is the actual panel skin plus smeared
substringers and smeared subrings.

Only the panel skin can have substiffeners.
As of this writing there can be no substiffeners attached to the webs or
outstanding flanges of major stiffeners. The substiffeners cannot be laminated
composite. They are modelled as if they were of a single orthotropic material
with user-specified E1, E2, G, nu, density, and maximum allowable stress components.

No attempt has yet been made to account properly for THERMAL loading in cases that
have substiffeners.

This paper is a summary of a section of the file called .../panda2/doc/panda2.news
called "Item no. 600" [1b]. Please see that file for details about input data, output
data, and "how to.." directions and suggestions with regard to obtaining optimum designs
with the new version of PANDA2. 


DESCRIPTION OF PANDA2

PANDA2 is a computer program for the minimum weight design of
stiffened, composite, flat or cylindrical, perfect or imperfect panels
and shells subjected to multiple sets of combined in-plane loads,
normal pressure, edge moments, and temperature.  For most
configurations the panels can be locally postbuckled. Previous work
on PANDA2 is documented in [1]. PANDA2 incorporates the theories of
earlier codes PANDA [41] and BOSOR4 [42]. The optimizer used in PANDA2
is called ADS [43,44]. Panels are optimized subject primarily to buckling
and stress constraints.


PANDA2 Processors and Types of Analysis

As described in [1], the PANDA2 system consists of several processors, 
BEGIN, SETUP, DECIDE, MAINSETUP, PANDAOPT, CHOOSEPLOT, CHANGE, 
STAGSMODEL, STAGSUNIT, etc. The functions of these processors
are as follows:

BEGIN		User establishes starting design, material properties,
		prebuckling and buckling boundary conditions.

SETUP		System sets up BOSOR4-type templates for stiffness and
		load-geometric matrices.

DECIDEi		User chooses decision variables and bounds and sets up
		equality and inequality constraints.

MAINSETUP	User chooses analysis type,  loading, and solution
		strategies.

PANDAOPT	Analysis type is performed (e.g. optimization).

CHOOSEPLOT	User chooses what to plot.

DIPLOT		The system obtains plots (postscript files).

CHANGE		User changes selected variables and constants.

AUTOCHANGE	A new starting design is automatically generated in a
		random manner.

SUPEROPT	An attempt is made to find a global optimum design.

PANEL		A BOSOR4 input file is generated for inter-ring buckling
		of panel skin and stringers, with stringers modelled as
		flexible shell branches.

PANEL2		A BOSOR4 input file is generated for inter-ring buckling
		of panel skin+smeared stringers with rings modelled as
		flexible shellbranches.

STAGSMODEL	Input files for STAGS [10-12] are generated (one
		finite element unit, only stringers are permitted).

STAGSUNIT	Input files for STAGS are generated (multiple shell
		units, both stringers and rings are permitted).

CLEANPAN	Delete all files except files containing user-provided
		input data for BEGIN, DECIDE, MAINSETUP, CHANGE, PANEL,
		PANEL2, STAGSMODEL and STAGSUNIT.


PANDA2 can be run in five modes:

	1. optimization
	2. simple analysis of a fixed design
	3. test simulation
	4. design sensitivity
	5. load-interaction (Nx,Ny), (Nx,Nxy), (Ny,Nxy)


Types of Buckling Included in PANDA2 Before Substiffeners Added

PANDA2 computes general, inter-ring, and local skin buckling loads and
mode shapes. General buckling is buckling in which both stringers (or
isogrid stiffeners) and rings participate; panel (inter-ring)
buckling is buckling between adjacent rings in which stringers (or
isogrid stiffeners) participate but the lines of intersection of ring
web roots with the panel skin do not translate; local buckling is
buckling of the panel skin between adjacent stringers (or isogrid
stiffeners) and rings. PANDA2 includes the following buckling models:

1. A discretized single skin-stringer module. This model is used for 
local buckling, local postbuckling, and wide column buckling of the 
panel region between adjacent rings (transverse stiffeners).

2. Simple models for the buckling of the panel skin and stiffener
segments of the type described in [41]. Typical buckling modes of the
panel skin and stiffeners are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 of [41]. In the 
panel skin the buckling nodal lines are assumed to be straight, as 
shown in Fig. 9 of [41]. This type of buckling model is used in some of
the software written by Arbocz and Hol [13-15] and by Khot and his colleagues
[22,23]. These models are called "PANDA-type (closed form)" in PANDA2
jargon because they are the only ones used in the original PANDA
program [41], which was superseded by PANDA2 [1] many years ago.  Over
the years an elaborate strategy has been developed in order to ensure
that for each type of buckling in this PANDA-type category,
the most critical (lowest) buckling load factor is not missed. The
critical eigenvalue is determined from several searches over various
regions in the (m,n,slope) domain, where m is the number of axial
halfwaves, n is the number of circumferential halfwaves, and
slope is the slope of the buckling nodal lines (non-zero when
there is in-plane shear loading and/or shell wall anisotropy).  More
details are given in the panda2.news file identified in [1].

For sandwich panels and shells PANDA2 computes load factors for
additional types of buckling that only occur for sandwich walls: face
sheet wrinkling, buckling over the diameter of a single cell of a
honeycomb core, and core crimping [1].

Three additional buckling models were fairly recently added to PANDA2 as
described in [1]:

3. Local buckling between adjacent stringers and rings of a cylindrical
or flat panel obtained from a Ritz model in which the buckling modal
displacement components, u, v, w,  are expanded in double trigonometric
series. The local region is assumed to be simply supported on all four
edges.

4. General buckling of a cylindrical panel in which stringers and rings
are treated as discrete beams with undeformable cross sections. Again,
the general buckling modal displacement components, u, v, w, are
expanded in double trigonometric series. The edges of the domain are
assumed to be simply supported and to have discrete stiffeners of half
the user-specified modulus. The domain for this model is a three-bay by
three-bay subdomain of the entire panel.

5. A discretized single module model for a cylindrical panel in which
the ring segments and panel skin-with-smeared-stringers are 
discretized. In this "branched shell" model the cross sections of the 
rings can deform in the buckling mode, since they are subdivided into 
finite elements of the type used in BOSOR4[42].

Buckling loads corresponding to a given type of buckling (such as local
buckling of the skin between stringers or general buckling) may be
computed by more than one model in order to verify results and to
provide appropriate knockdown factors to account for anisotropy,
inherent unconservativeness in smearing stiffeners, the presence of in-
plane shear loading, and variation of in-plane loading within the
domain that buckles. The effect of transverse shear deformation (t.s.d.)
is accounted for as described in [1].

PANDA2 can optimize imperfect stiffened panels and shells [1]. 
Imperfections are assumed to be in the shapes of the general, 
inter-ring, and local buckling modes obtained from the PANDA-type model 
identified as Item No. 2 above. Imperfections in stiffened panels and 
shells have two major effects:

a. The imperfect panel or shell bends as soon as any loading is 
applied. This bending causes significant redistribution of stresses 
between the panel skin and the various stiffener parts, thus affecting 
significantly many buckling and stress constraints in the optimization 
problem.

b. The "effective" curvature of a cylindrical panel or shell depends on 
the amplitude of the initial imperfection and on the circumferential 
wavelength of the critical buckling mode of the perfect shell. This 
"effective" curvature is larger than the nominal radius of curvature 
because it corresponds to the radius of a typical inward 
circumferential lobe of the initial and subsequently load-amplified 
buckling modal imperfection. In PANDA2 this larger local radius of 
curvature is assumed to be the governing radius in the buckling 
equations pertaining to the imperfect shell.


Local post buckling analysis

An analysis branch exists in which local post buckling of the panel
skin is accounted for [1]. In this branch a constraint condition
that prevents stiffener pop-off is introduced into the optimization
calculations. The postbuckling theory incorporated into PANDA2 is
similar to that formulated by Koiter for panels loaded into the far-
postbuckling regime [45].


Stress constraints

In addition to buckling constraints, PANDA2 computes stress constraints
including local postbuckling deformations and thermal loading by both
curing and applied temperature distributions. For laminated composite
walls PANDA2 generates stress constraints corresponding to maximum
tension along fibers, maximum compression along fibers, maximum tension
transverse to fibers, maximum compression transverse to fibers, and
maximum in-plane shear stress for each different material in a
stiffened panel. For isotropic material PANDA2 generates stress
constraints based on the von Mises effective stress.


Global optimizer called SUPEROPT introduced into PANDA2

Global optimum designs can be obtained with PANDA2 by means of multiple 
sequential executions of a processor called SUPEROPT, which is 
described in more detail in [1]. At intervals during the optimization
process new starting designs are automatically generated as follows:

    y(i) = x(i)[1 + dx(i)], i = 1,2,3...number of decision variables (1)

in which x(i) is the old value of the ith decision variable, y(i) is
the new value, and dx(i) is a random number between -0.5 and +1.5 if the
decision variable is other than a stiffener spacing and a random number
between -1.0 and +1.0 if the decision variable is a stiffener spacing.
The difference in treatment for decision variables that are not
stiffener spacings from those that are results from early experiments
with SUPEROPT. In order to obtain global optimum designs it is almost 
always necessary to execute SUPEROPT several times in succession, not 
just once or twice.


Frequent use of "knockdown" factors in PANDA2

As mentioned in previous PANDA2 literature, in PANDA2 knockdown factors are used often.
There are knockdown factors for weakening due to transverse shear deformation (t.s.d.),
to compensate for the inherent unconservativeness of smearing stiffeners, to
compensate for anisotropic effects and the application of in-plane shear loading,
to compensate for initial imperfections, and to compensate for possible truncation
error in the double trigonometric series expansions used in the alternative buckling
models.


DESCRIPTION OF STAGS

STAGS (STructural Analysis of General Shells) is a finite element code for
general-purpose nonlinear analysis of stiffened shell structures of
arbitrary shape and complexity. Its capabilities include stress,
stability, vibration, and transient analyses with both material and
geometric nonlinearities permitted in all analysis types.
STAGS includes enhancements, such as a higher order thick shell element,
more advanced nonlinear solution strategies, and more comprehensive
post-processing features such as a link with STAPL [1b].

Research and development of STAGS by Brogan, Almroth, Rankin, Stanley,
Cabiness, Stehlin and others of the Computational Mechanics Department of
the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory has been under continuous
sponsorship from U.S. government agencies and internal Lockheed funding
for the past 30 years.  During this time particular emphasis has been
placed on improvement of the capability to solve difficult nonlinear
problems such as the prediction of the behavior of axially compressed
stiffened panels loaded far into their locally postbuckled states. STAGS
has been extensively used worldwide for the evaluation of stiffened panels
and shells loaded well into their locally postbuckled states. See [12], for
example.

A large rotation algorithm that is independent of the finite element
library has been incorporated into STAGS [46].  With this algorithm there
is no artificial stiffening due to large rotations.  The finite elements
in the STAGS library do not store energy under arbitrary rigid-body motion
and the first and second variations of the strain energy are consistent.
These properties lead to quadratic convergence during Newton iterations.

Solution control in nonlinear problems includes specification of load
levels or use of the advanced Riks-Crisfield path parameter [12] that enables
traversal of limit points into the post-buckling regime. Two load systems
with different histories (Load Sets A and B) can be defined and controlled
separately during the solution process. Flexible restart procedures permit
switching from one strategy to another during an analysis.  This includes
shifts from bifurcation buckling to nonlinear collapse analyses and back
and shifts from static to transient and transient to static analyses with
modified boundary conditions and loading.  STAGS provides solutions to the
generalized eigenvalue problem for buckling and vibration from a linear or
nonlinear stress state.

Quadric surfaces can be modeled with minimal user input as individual
substructures called "shell units" in which the analytic geometry is
represented exactly. "Shell units" can be connected along edges or
internal grid lines with partial or complete compatibility.  In this way
complex structures can be assembled from relatively simple units.
Alternatively, a structure of arbitrary shape can be modelled with use of
an "element unit".

Geometric imperfections can be generated automatically in a variety of
ways, thereby permitting imperfection-sensitivity studies to be performed.
For example, imperfections can be generated by superposition of several
buckling modes determined from previous STAGS analyses of a given case.

A variety of material models is available, including both plasticity and
creep. STAGS handles isotropic and anisotropic materials, including
composites consisting of up to 60 layers of arbitrary orientation. Four
plasticity models are available, including isotropic strain hardening, the
White Besseling (mechanical sublayer model), kinematic strain hardening,
and deformation theory.

Two independent load sets, each composed from simple parts that may be
specified with minimal input, define a spatial variation of loading. Any
number of point loads, prescribed displacements, line loads, surface
tractions, thermal loads, and "live" pressure (hydrostatic pressure which
remains normal to the shell surface throughout large deformations) can be
combined to make a load set. For transient analysis the user may select
from a menu of loading histories, or a general temporal variation may be
specified in a user-written subroutine.

Boundary conditions (B.C.) may be imposed either by reference to certain
standard conditions or by the use of single- and multi-point constraints.
Simple support, symmetry, antisymmetry, clamped, or user-defined B.C. can
be defined on a "shell unit" edge.  Single-point constraints which allow
individual freedoms to be free, fixed, or a prescribed non-zero value may
be applied to grid lines and surfaces in "shell units" or "element units".
 A useful feature for buckling analysis allows these constraints to differ
for the prestress and eigenvalue analyses. Langrangian constraint
equations containing up to 100 terms may be defined to impose multi-point
constraints.

STAGS has a variety of finite elements suitable for the analysis of
stiffened plates and shells.  Simple four node quadrilateral plate
elements with a cubic lateral displacement field (called "410" and "411"
elements) are effective and efficient for the prediction of postbuckling
thin shell response.  A linear (410) or quadratic (411) membrane
interpolation can be selected.  For thicker shells in which transverse
shear deformation is important, STAGS provides the Assumed Natural Strain
(ANS) nine node element (called "480" element).  A two node beam element
compatible with the four node quadrilateral plate element is provided to
simulate stiffeners and beam assemblies.  Other finite elements included
in STAGS are described in the STAGS literature [10-12].


THEORY AND MODIFICATIONS TO PANDA2 TO PERMIT SUBSTIFFENERS

With the introduction of substiffeners between major stiffeners, there are
many new buckling constraints introduced into the optimization problem,
such as buckling of the panel skin between substiffeners including rolling
of the substiffeners, buckling of the panel skin with smeared substringers
between adjacent subrings, buckling of the substringers, buckling of the
subrings, and buckling from the alternative theory (double trigonometric
series expansions) of various "patches" involving segments of the panel
skin with discrete substiffeners.

These new constraints are generated in PANDA2 by means of new coding that
is analogous to that previously existing for buckling of segments of the
major stiffeners and for buckling of sections of the panel skin stiffened
by major stiffeners.

In the case of a panel with substiffeners that form an isogrid pattern
between adjacent major stringers and rings, a new capability has been implemented
with regard to buckling of the triangular portion
of panel skin between adjacent isogrid members. Previously, the buckling
theory was based on the assumption that the triangular piece of panel skin
between adjacent isogrid members was simply supported along its three edges.
The contributions of stiffener rolling to the strain energy and work done by
prebuckling stiffener resultants during buckling modal rotations were neglected.
Now, provided that the stiffeners are of rectangular cross section (as is always
the case with substiffeners), these contributions are included. For panels
in which the major stiffeners form an isogrid pattern, if the major stiffeners
are of rectangular cross section, their rolling during buckling modal rotations
is now included. If the major stiffeners form an isogrid pattern, substiffeners
are not allowed.

There are new stress constraints that involve the substiffeners.


EXAMPLE

The numerical results presented here are all derived from an example of
an aluminum cylindrical shell, the dimensions, material properties, loading,
boundary conditions, and imperfection for which are listed in Table 1. Table 2 lists
the names and definitions of all the variables that may or may not be
decision variables in optimization problems. Variable No. 2, the stringer
base B2(STR), is always equal to one tenth the stringer spacing in this study,
and the properties of the wall in the stringer base are the same as those
in the wall midway between stringers; there is no stringer faying
flange. The width of the ring base, B2(RNG), is always zero in this study.

The new variables pertaining to the substiffeners are called TSUB (thickness),
HSUB (height), and BSUB (spacing). In the examples presented here there are always
both substringers and subrings.

Table 3 lists the starting design and optimum designs for perfect and imperfect
shells with and without substiffeners. One can see from the weights listed that
there is little advantage of adding substiffeners from the point of view of
weight alone.


RUNSTREAM TO OBTAIN THE "GLOBAL" OPTIMUM DESIGN

The runstream to produce a "global" optimum design is listed in Table 4. The case name is
"testax4p". "Global" is in quotes because there is no guarantee that the optimum is truly
a global optimum design. The more sets of "superopt/chooseplot/diplot" the user executes,
the more likely it is that a truly global optimum design will result. In the "global"
optimization in this case, there were four executions of the sequence
SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT.

Each execution of SUPEROPT must be followed by an
execution of CHOOSEPLOT because CHOOSEPLOT is where the total number of design
iterations gets reset to zero between executions of SUPEROPT. This must always
be done before the next execution of SUPEROPT.

Figure 2 shows a plot of the objective function vs design iterations after
the first execution of SUPEROPT for the perfect shell with substiffeners.
The final optimum design of the perfect shell is listed in Column 3 of Table 3.


RESULTS CORRESPONDING TO THE "GLOBAL" OPTIMUM DESIGN: PERFECT SHELL WITH
SUBSTIFFENERS

With substiffeners present there exist many new margins. Table 5 lists
the margins corresponding to the optimized perfect cylindrical panel
with T-shaped major stringers and T-shaped rings and with rectangular substringers 
and subrings (case name = "testax4p"). The optimum dimensions are listed
in Column 3 of Table 3.

The new margins pertaining to substiffeners are listed in Table 6.

In PANDA2 the new margins involving substiffeners are computed in a manner
analogous to similar margins involving major stiffeners. For example, Margin 21
in Table 6 is computed from the PANDA-type (closed-form) theory in which the effect of
rolling of the substiffeners along the edges of a local region of skin between
adjacent substiffeners is included. In PANDA2 models with IQUICK=1 (no discretized
skin-stringer module model) and no alternative solution and no substiffeners and
major stiffeners with rectangular cross sections, there is an analogous margin: 

 "buck.(SAND);rolling with local buck.; M=1;N=1;slope=0.2236;FS=1.

computed from the same subroutines.

Margins 22 and 23 in Table 6 are computed from the same subroutines as those for
the analogous margins that involve major stiffeners. For example, the
"old" margin pertaining to a major stringer (Table 5),

 7  1.76E+00 buckling margin stringer Iseg.3 . Local halfwaves=8  .MID.;FS=1.

is computed in SUBROUTINE STFEIG. (In this particular case there is no buckling
of ring "Iseg.3" because there exists only tension along the axis of the ring web).

The new margins pertaining to a substringer and subring,
 
22 -4.04E-04 buckling:simp-support of substring.M=1;FS=1.
23  1.14E+01 buckling:simp-support of subrings  N=1;FS=1.

are computed from statements taken from SUBROUTINE STFEIG and inserted in
the proper place in SUBROUTINE BUCPAN.

The new margins 24, 25,and 27 in Table 6, computed from the alternative buckling theory
described in [1]:

24 -2.86E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln4  intermajorpatch; FS=0.999
25  3.21E-01 buckling:simp-support altsoln5  skin+edgsubroll; FS=0.999
27  5.78E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln6  inter-subring  ; FS=0.999

are calculated in the same subroutine, ALTSOL, used for computation of the
"old" margins (Table 5): 

12  1.53E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support smearsubstf; (0.95*altsol);FS=0.999
13 -3.84E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999
15  2.35E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

The new alternative buckling models are analogous to the old. The new margin (Table 6),

25  3.21E-01 buckling:simp-support altsoln5  skin+edgsubroll; FS=0.999

is analogous to the "old" one (Table 5),

12  1.53E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support smearsubstf; (0.95*altsol);FS=0.999

In the new margin (Margin 25) the buckling domain is the panel skin between
adjacent substiffeners with rolling of the substiffeners along the edges of
the domain included in the model. In the old margin, (Margin 12 in Table 5) the domain
is the panel skin + smeared substiffeners between adjacent major stiffeners.

The new margin (Table 6),

27  5.78E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln6  inter-subring  ; FS=0.999

is analogous to the "old" one (Table 5),

13 -3.84E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999

In the new margin (Margin 27) the buckling domain is the panel skin plus
substringers between subrings. A 6-substringer-bay model is used. In the
"old" margin (Margin 13) the domain is the panel skin + smeared substiffeners
between adjacent major rings. A 6-major-stringer-bay model is now used. (See
panda2,news Item No. 603. Previously it was a 3-major-stringer bay model.)

The new margin (Table 6),

24 -2.86E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln4  intermajorpatch; FS=0.999

is analogous to the "old" one (Table 5),

15  2.35E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

In the new margin (Margin 24) the buckling domain is an N-substringer-bay x
M-subring-bay "patch", in which N can be as high as 6 and M can be as
high as 5. In the "old" margin (Margin 15) the buckling domain is an
N-major-stringer bay x M-major-ring-bay "patch", in which N can be as high
as 6 and M can be as high as 5, with substringers and subrings smeared.
(See panda2.news Item No. 603 for the recent modification of the way
in which the "old" Margin 15 is now computed with a larger "patch" than
was previously used. The old "patch" had 3-major-ring bays x 3-major-stringer
bays.) 

The two new margins pertaining to substiffeners (Table 6),

28  5.77E+00 buck.(SAND);rolling with smear subrng;M=39;N=1;slope=0.01;FS=0.999
29  6.91E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling only of substring;M=20;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6

are analogous to the two "old" margins pertaining to major stiffeners (Table 5):

16  5.72E+00 buck.(SAND);rolling with smear rings; M=52;N=1;slope=0.01;FS=0.999
17  6.94E-03 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=16;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6

The two new margins pertaining to substiffeners (Table 6),

26  2.18E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling with smear substr;M=1;N=2;slope=16.67;FS=0.999
30  8.00E+00 buck.(SAND);rolling only of subrings; M=0;N=4;slope=0.;FS=1.6

are analogous to similar "old" margins pertaining to major stiffeners. However,
the "old" margins, although computed, are not recorded as constraints on the
design because they are both superceded by the discretized skin-with-smeared-
stringers/ring single module model that yields the margin (Table 5),

 4  2.53E-02 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=6   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

With the NPRINT index set equal to 2 in the *.OPT file, PANDA2 prints messages
such as the following:

 Inter-ring buckling with smeared stringers and ring rolling
 is not recorded as a margin because this type of buckling
 has been superceded by the results from the discretized
 inter-ring module model, for which inter-ring buckling
 load factors have been computed in the range from n =     1
 to n =    70 circumferential halfwaves.
 The critical inter-ring-buckling-with-ring-rolling model has    7
 circ. half waves, which lies within this range.

 Ring rolling without participation of the panel skin
 is not recorded as a margin because this type of buckling
 has been superceded by the results from the discretized
 "skin"-ring module model, for which buckling load factors
 have been computed in the range from n =     1 to n =    70 circ. halfwaves.
 The critical ring-rolling-without-participation-of-the-panel-skin model has    7
 circ. half waves, which lies within this range.

Please see panda2.news Item No. 463 [1] for more about the discretized module
model that involves the panel skin with smeared major stringers and a single
discretized major ring cross section and how this model supercedes several
buckling constraints that involve major ring rolling. Note that there exists no
analogous discretized skin-with-smeared-substringers/subring module model.
Therefore, margins such as Margin No. 26 and Margin No. 30 are recorded and
not superceded by any other buckling model.

Table 7 lists margins in which the substringers and subrings are smeared
in the manner of Baruch and Singer [9].

Margins 1-3 in Table 7:
 1  2.53E-02 Local buckling from discrete model-1.,M=2   axial halfwaves;FS=0.99
 2  2.23E-01 Bending-torsion buckling; M=2  ;FS=0.999
 3  3.24E-01 (m=2   lateral-torsional buckling load factor)/(FS)-1;FS=0.999

are from the discretized "skin"-major-stringer single module model. In
Margin 1 the term "local" means "local buckling of the "skin" between major
stringers. In the presence of substiffeners, what used to be called the panel
skin is now the panel skin-with-smeared-substiffeners. Margins 2 and 3 are
computed from the same discretized single module model with smeared substiffeners.

With substiffeners present there exist buckling modes more local than that
corresponding to Margin 1. For example, the margin, 

21  4.60E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling with skin buckl.; M=1;N=1;slope=0.1939;FS=0.999

(Table 6) involves local buckling of the panel skin between adjacent substiffeners,
with rolling of the substiffeners included in the model.

Margins 4 and 13 in Table 7,

 4  2.53E-02 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=6   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999
13 -3.84E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999

are computed with substiffeners smeared and major stringers smeared.

Margin 12 in Table 7,

12  1.53E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support smearsubstf; (0.95*altsol);FS=0.999

used to be called "buck.(SAND);simp-support local buckling; (0.95*altsol)". It
is generated from the same alternative buckling theory (double trigonometric series
expansion) as before when there existed only skin between adjacent stringers and
rings. Now the domain between adjacent major stringers and rings includes smeared
substiffeners.

Margins 14 and 15 in Table 7,

14 -2.02E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=6;N=0;slope=0.4637;FS=0.999
15  2.35E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

are derived from two different models of general instability, a closed form
PANDA-type model in which all stiffeners (major and sub) are smeared out (Margin 14)
and an alternative (double trig series expansion) model in which the substiffeners
are smeared out and the major stiffeners are treated as discrete beams in a
6-major stringer bay by 5-major-ring-bay "patch" (Margin 15).

Margin 16 in Table 7,

16  5.72E+00 buck.(SAND);rolling with smear rings; M=52;N=1;slope=0.01;FS=0.999

is generated from a model in which the substiffeners as well as the major rings
are smeared out and the major stringers are treated as discrete beams that run
along the two generators at the straight edges of the long, narrow domain that
includes the entire length of shell between two adjacent major stringers.


GENERATING AN OPTIMUM DESIGN THAT CAN BE ANALYZED WITH STAGS

It is important to evaluate the optimum design obtained by PANDA2 by use of
a general-purpose finite element program operating on the same design. The
general-purpose finite element program STAGS [10-12] was used. The PANDA2 processor
STAGSUNIT [1] had to be modified to work for panels with substiffeners.

In order to generate a PANDA2 model that, via STAGSUNIT, produces suitable input
files, *.bin and *.inp, for STAGS, it is necessary first to find an optimum design
with PANDA2 in which there are integral numbers of major stiffeners over the entire 
domain of the STAGS model and integral numbers of substiffeners between adjacent
major stiffeners. This is done by the following steps:

1. Use the PANDA2 processor called CHANGE to reset the variables,
B(STR), B2(STR), B(RNG) BSUB(substringer), BSUB(subrings)
so that there are integral numbers of each kind of stiffener
in the appropriate domains. Choose values that are close to
those found in the optimum designs listed in Table 3. (See Table 8
for appropriate values of the stiffener spacings for STAGS models).

2. Use the PANDA2 processor called DECIDE. The stiffener spacings
B(STR), B2(STR), B(RNG) BSUB(substringer), BSUB(subrings),
should no longer be decision variables, and the therefore inappropriate
inequality constraints,

a. The stringer spacing must be at least 3 times the substringer spacing.
b. The ring spacing must be at least 3 times the subring spacing.

should be eliminated.

3. Execute SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT at least once to find a new "global"
optimum design for which there are integral numbers of major stiffeners
and substiffeners in the appropriate domains.

4. Execute PANDAOPT once more for a fixed design: the optimum design.

New optimum designs suitable for analysis by STAGS are listed in Table 8.

The margins corresponding to the perfect shell with substiffeners (second
column in Table 8) are listed in Table 9.


CREATION OF STAGS MODELS

STAGS models, such as that shown in Fig. 1, are generated via the PANDA2 processor 
called STAGSUNIT. The purpose of STAGSUNIT is to generate the two input files,
*.bin and *.inp, for the STAGS general purpose finite element program. In this
example "*" stands for the case name, "testax4p". Typical input data files for
STAGSUNIT are listed in several tables in [1b].

As described in [1],
the processor STAGSUNIT is written in such a way that "patches" of various portions 
of a complete panel or shell can be analyzed with STAGS. The correct prebuckled
state of a perfect panel is preserved independently of the size of the "patch"
to be included in the STAGS model. The minimum size "patch" must contain at
least one major stiffener spacing in each direction, and major stringers are
always included along the two straight edges of the "patch".
There may or may not be rings running along the two curved edges of the "patch",
depending on input to STAGSUNIT provided by the user of PANDA2.
Stiffeners that run along the four boundaries of the "patch" have half the
stiffness of those that lie within the "patch". Figure 1 shows a STAGS "patch"
model that includes only three bays between major stringers (four major
stringers) and one bay between two major rings.

Substiffeners always lie within the patch. There must always be integral numbers
of uniformly spaced substiffeners (substringers and/or subrings) between adjacent
major stiffeners. The substiffeners that are closest to the major stiffeners are
one half a substiffener spacing away from the major stiffeners. Substringers
and subrings never occur along coordinate lines where there exist major
stringers and/or major rings. As of this writing STAGSUNIT cannot handle
isogrid stiffening or substiffening.

The STAGS models are constructed by the PANDA2 processor STAGSUNIT in such a
way that all stiffeners (major and sub) are connected only to the panel skin.
That is, where stiffeners intersect they simply pass through eachother with
no constraints between them along their lines of intersection. This is a
conservative model with respect to buckling.

There can be gaps between the
roots of the stiffeners and the reference surface of the panel skin. For
example, if the reference surface of the panel skin is the middle surface,
there are gaps equal to half the skin thickness. The user can elect to have
what in STAGS jargon are called "fasteners" that relate the nodal displacement
components on the skin reference surface to those at the root of a stiffener
web. The STAGS model shown in Fig. 1 has fasteners. They can barely be seen
as tiny black dots at nodal points along the roots of all the stiffeners.

Several examples of input data for the PANDA2 processor, STAGSUNIT, are given
in [1b]. Detailed instructions on running STAGSUNIT followed by running STAGS
are also listed there.


RESULTS FROM STAGS

The execution of STAGS produces a number of files. The user must inspect the *.out1 and
*.out2 files if the STAGS run bombs. The user must inspect the *.out2 file if the run
finishes in a normal fashion.

Table 10 lists the most important part of the testax4p.out2 file generated from the 
successful STAGS run to which Fig. 3 corresponds: a three-axial-bay by nine-
circumferential-bay "patch" in which all of the major stiffeners and substiffeners
are modelled as shell units and in which the "480" STAGS finite element is used
throughout the STAGS model. The middle surface is used as the reference surface of the
cylindrical skin and there exist fasteners that connect this middle surface to the
roots of the stiffeners.

The buckling modes corresponding to the eigenvalues (buckling load factors) listed
in Table 10 are all mixtures of the types corresponding to the following margins
from PANDA2 (Table 9):

 1  1.24E-01 Local buckling from discrete model-1.,M=2   axial halfwaves;FS=0.99
 2  3.38E-01 Bending-torsion buckling; M=2  ;FS=0.999
 3  4.50E-01 (m=2   lateral-torsional buckling load factor)/(FS)-1;FS=0.999
 4  1.03E-02 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=6   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999
13 -3.76E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999
17 -2.58E-02 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=14;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6
24 -4.18E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln4  intermajorpatch; FS=0.999

The numbers listed under "TYPES OF BUCKLING" in Table 10 correspond to the PANDA2
margins from Table 9 and repeated just above.

According to PANDA2, the three types of buckling

 1  1.24E-01 Local buckling from discrete model-1.,M=2   axial halfwaves;FS=0.99
 2  3.38E-01 Bending-torsion buckling; M=2  ;FS=0.999
 3  4.50E-01 (m=2   lateral-torsional buckling load factor)/(FS)-1;FS=0.999

are not critical. In contrast, these three modes play a prominant role in the STAGS 
model of buckling. In PANDA2 the domain used for these three types of buckling includes
only the axial dimension between adjacent major rings. Therefore, the string "M=2" means
"two axial halfwaves between major rings". In the STAGS model the axial wavelength of
the "bending-torsion" buckling or "lateral-torsional" buckling (sidesway of the major
stringers) is not restricted to the distance between adjacent major rings because
the stiffeners are allowed to deform relative to eachother where they intersect. The
PANDA2 model that leads to the margin,

17 -2.58E-02 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=14;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6

also allows the stringers to deform relative to the major rings because the domain
is the entire axial length of the panel. Therefore, the string "M=14" means "14
axial halfwaves over the entire axial length of the panel". The inclusion of this
type of buckling prevents PANDA2 from yielding an unconservative design in this
case because the buckling domain is longer than one major ring spacing.

Figure 3 shows the buckling mode from STAGS corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue
(buckling load factor), 0.97738.

Figure 4 shows the "same" STAGS model and buckling mode except that the STAGS 410
finite element is used for the panel skin and the major stiffeners and the STAGS
210 finite element is used for the substiffeners. If any stiffeners
(major or sub) are modelled as beams (210 element), then the user has no
choice: the STAGS 410 element MUST be used for all shell units since this element
is compatible with the STAGS 210 beam element.

Figure 5 shows the fundamental buckling mode from the same model that produced
Figure 3 except that the substiffeners are smeared out in the manner of Baruch
and Singer [9]. The buckling modes from STAGS are similar to those corresponding
to the STAGS models in which the substiffeners are treated as shell units
except that there is little evidence of the type of buckling from PANDA2's
margin 24: "intermajorpatch".


GENERAL BUCKLING MODE(S) FROM STAGS

Of particular interest is the determination of the general buckling load factor
according to STAGS. In this case one must include the entire cylindrical
shell in the STAGS model. Because of the presence of uniform in-plane
shear loading, Nxy, (Table 1) there are no planes of symmetry. In the STAGS
model of the entire shell the substiffeners are smeared out and the major stiffeners
are treated as shell units. The STAGS "480" finite element is used throughout. The
outer surface of the panel skin is used as the reference surface and there are no
fasteners in this particular model.

In order to find the lowest long-wavelength general buckling mode in this case it is
necessary to make several STAGS runs, each successive run with a slightly higher
initial eigenvalue "shift". This has
to be done because there are many "inter-ring" buckling modes that have eigenvalues
(buckling load factors) that bracket the lowest eigenvalue corresponding to the 
general buckling mode. "Inter-ring" is in quotation marks here because most of these
short-wavelength modes involve significant in-plane bending of the major rings,
as will be seen later. This places them in the "general buckling" category. Three
STAGS runs were required in this case to obtain the lowest long-wavelength general
buckling mode (Mode 19).

There are results from two sets of three runs each listed in Table 600.24 of [1b].
The first set of three runs corresponds to a model in which the outer surface
of the shell skin is used as a reference surface and there are no fasteners.
The second set of three runs corresponds to a model in which the middle surface
of the shell skin is used as a reference surface and there are fasteners. The
effect of this difference in modeling is minor: The buckling load factors from
the model with fasteners are from one to two per cent lower than those without
fasteners.

The general buckling load factor, 1.0511, for the "no fasteners" model,
corresponds to the 19th eigenvalue. This general buckling mode has three
circumferential waves. The general buckling load factor, 1.04201, for
the "fasteners" model, also corresponds to the 19th eigenvalue for that
model and also has three circumferential waves.

The buckling mode corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue, 1.022198E+00, is
shown in Fig. 6 and the buckling mode for the lowest eigenvalue corresponding
to long-wavelength general instability, 1.051100E+00, is shown in Fig. 7. Both of these modes
are for the STAGS model with no fasteners. The modes for the STAGS model with
fasteners, corresponding to the first eigenvalue, 1.008428, and to the 19th
eigenvalue, 1.042010,  are essentially the same.

All of the other eigenvalues correspond approximately to "inter-ring" buckling modes
similar to that in Fig. 6. In these relatively short wavelength buckling modes
the axes of the stringers deform and the rings primarily twist. However, for
most of the rings the axes of the rings also deform, as shown in Fig. 8. Figure 8
is produced by elimination of all the shell units except the two shell units
that correspond to the web and outstanding flange of the fourth ring from the
left end of the model shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 8 the
buckling modal deformations for the same mode (Mode No. 1) as that shown in
Fig. 6 are plotted to the same scale as is shown in Fig. 6. Because there is
significant bending in the plane of this and in the planes of the other rings, 
these "inter-ring" modes may also be considered to have significant components 
of general buckling: a short-wavelength general buckling mode similar in type to
that shown in Figs. 21, 26, 27, 29 of the paper, 
"Additional buckling solutions in PANDA2" [1].

For a complete (360 degrees) cylindrical shell the converged eigenvalues (buckling load
factors) occur in pairs. This is typical in STAGS models of complete (360-degree) cylindrical
shells. The buckling mode corresponding to each eigenvalue in a pair is the same except 
that one mode in the pair is rotated around the shell circumference relative to the
other.


RESULTS FROM STAGS MODELS OF THE COMPLETE CYLINDRICAL SHELL WITH ALL STIFFENERS 
(MAJOR AND SUB) SMEARED

STAGS produces the results listed in Table 11.
The critical buckling mode is shown in Fig. 9 and the buckling mode corresponding
to the third eigenvalue, 1.371375, is shown in Figs. 10 and 11. The axisymmetric
buckling load factor, 1.371375, is not far above the critical buckling load factor,
1.288339, which corresponds to a general buckling mode with three circumferential
waves, essentially the same buckling mode as that shown in Fig. 7.

A similar STAGS model was run with use of the "410" finite element rather than the
"480" finite element. For that model, the same nodal point density leads to a
prediction of general buckling at a load factor (eigenvalue) of 1.340773, reasonably
close to the 1.288339 obtained from the model with use of the 480 finite element.
The order of the n=2 and n=0 modes is reversed compared to that for the model
in which the STAGS "480" finite element was used (Table 11). 

Although the critical general buckling mode according to STAGS
has long wavelengths (one halfwave in the axial direction and three full waves
over the entire circumference), a model in which all stiffeners are smeared
produces a prediction that is unacceptably unconservative (Table 11).
Compare the STAGS buckling load factor, 1.288339, from the smeared stiffener model
with the STAGS buckling load factor from the model in which the substiffeners are
smeared but the major stiffeners are modelled as shell units and fasteners are
included: lowest eigenvalue = 1.04201.
The model in which all stiffeners are smeared is unconservative by about 24 per cent.

With use of the "410" finite element rather than the "480" finite element in the
STAGS model, the unconservativeness of the smeared model:

	general buckling load factors = 1.340773E+00 vs 1.042010E+00,

is even more pronounced. The conclusion is that even though the general buckling
mode in Fig. 7 appears to be smooth, it does not seem to be good practice to smear the
major stiffeners for optimized shells. Models with smeared stiffeners may well lead to
unacceptably unconservative designs.


COMMENTS ON DIFFERENCES IN BUCKLING MODES FROM STAGS AND PANDA2 FOR THE PERFECT SHELL

STAGS is a general-purpose finite element program. Therefore, the buckling modes
obtained from STAGS do not necessarily have to fall into a classification such
as "general" or "inter-ring" or "local" or "stiffener rolling without participation
of the panel skin", etc. For example, a buckling mode from STAGS may be a combination
of "general" and "inter-ring". The buckling load factors listed in Table 10 
correspond to buckling modes of this "mixed" type. Also, the buckling mode shown
in Figs. 6 and 8 is a mixture of general and inter-ring buckling.

What may be termed a "general buckling" mode from STAGS for descriptive purposes
is not always a "pure" general buckling mode. The AIAA Paper 2002-1408 [1] 
shows examples of "pure" and "not so pure"
general buckling modes. Figure 25 of that paper shows a "pure" general buckling
mode; Figure 24 shows a "somewhat impure" general buckling mode; and Figure 23
shows a "very impure" general buckling mode. The "impure" general buckling modes
have differing degrees of short-wavelength deformation superposed on what is basically
a general buckling mode. (Incidentally, Figures 20-22 of AIAA Paper 2002-1408 show
an "inter-ring" buckling mode similar in nature to the "inter-ring" modes in
the present case; there is considerable deformation of at least one ring in its
plane, as displayed in Fig. 22 of that paper, making the mode a combination of
"inter-ring" buckling and "general buckling".)

The classifications of "general", "inter-ring", "local", etc. ARE meaningful in the 
PANDA2 "universe", however. PANDA2 arrives at reasonable optimum designs with
reasobable computer execution times through the use of many different simplified
models for the prediction of buckling and stress. In applying PANDA2, one
expects that the appropriate combination of these simplified models will
lead to reliable preliminary optimum designs that are not too conservative and
for which all the "holes have been plugged", that is, there are not any critical
modes of failure that have been overlooked. Over the many years that PANDA2 has
been evolving, many such "holes" have been discovered and eliminated. (See the
file, ..panda2/doc/panda2.news [1]).

Table 600.30 in [1b] lists results from PANDA2 computations for the types of buckling
that are seen to occur in the STAGS models of the complete (360-degree) cylindrical
shell to which the results shown in Figs. 6-11 correspond. Results from
ten different buckling models are listed there, including three models of inter-ring
buckling, two models of general buckling, and five models of stiffener buckling.
Several comments, "<--NOTE...", and several paragraphs of comments have been added
to the standard PANDA2 output
listed in Table 600.30 in [1b] in order to help give the reader a physical "feel" for
what is going on. The information given in that table, which is too
long to include in this paper, should be absorbed by any researcher interested in
using PANDA2 and understanding how it tries to solve difficult shell problems
reasonably accurately through the use of many different approximate models.

The critical STAGS buckling mode for short-wavelength "general" buckling is shown
in Fig. 6 and the critical STAGS buckling mode for long-wavelength general buckling
is shown in Fig. 7. As seen from Fig. 8 the short-wavelength "general" buckling mode
has five circumferential waves around the 360-degree circumference of the cylindrical
shell. The long-wavelength general buckling mode has three circumferential waves.

PANDA2 uses two models for general instability, to which the following two
margins, taken from Table 9, correspond:

14 -3.66E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=6;N=0;slope=0.473;FS=0.999
15  6.26E-04 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

The first margin, Margin No. 14, is computed from the closed-form PANDA-type model [41].
In that model all stiffeners are smeared out and transverse shear deformation (t.s.d.)
is neglected. PANDA2 makes an elaborate search over (m,n,slope) = (MWAVEX,NWAVEX,SLOPEX)
space for the critical (lowest) buckling load factor, EIGMNC, in which MWAVEX = number of
axial halfwaves over the entire shell, NWAVEX = number of circumferential halfwaves
over 180 degrees of circumference (the "width" of the panel = pi x r), and
SLOPEX = the slope of the buckling nodal
lines, non-zero in this case because of the presence of in-plane shear loading,
Nxy = 20000 lb. The search over (m,n,slope) space must be thorough because there
often are multiple minima of buckling load factor vs (m,n,slope). The following
lines are typical PANDA2 output giving the results of this thorough search:

EIGMNC=  1.52E+00  1.52E+00  1.69E+00  1.93E+00  1.69E+00  1.52E+00  1.48E+00
SLOPEX=  6.81E-01  6.81E-01  1.00E-02  1.32E-01  0.00E+00  6.81E-01  4.73E-01
MWAVEX=    1         1         7         6         7         1         6
NWAVEX=    3         3         2         4         2         3         0

In this particular case there are at least four minima in (m,n,slope) space,
corresponding to (m,n) = (1,3), (7,2), (6,4), and (6,0) and various nodal line
slopes. [Question: Why do we write, "at least four minima", instead of, "four minima"?
Answer: For given (m,n) there are often two minmima over the practical
range of nodal line slope]. PANDA2 chooses the
smallest EIGMNC as the critical buckling load factor and mode shape
for general buckling from the closed-form PANDA-type theory [41].

Notice that in this particular case the general buckling load factors
corresponding to the buckling modes (m,n.slope) = (1,3,0.681) and (6,0,0.473)
are fairly close: 1.52 and 1.48, respectively. The (1,3,0.681) buckling mode
is similar to the STAGS mode
from the smeared stiffener model shown in Fig. 9. The (6,0,0.473) buckling
mode is similar to the STAGS mode from the smeared stiffener model shown in
Figs. 10 and 11 (axisymmetric mode).

PANDA2 "knocks down" the most critical buckling load factor from PANDA-type theory
as follows:

Buckling load factor before t.s.d.= 1.4820E+00 After t.s.d.=  1.4019E+00
Buckling load factor BEFORE knockdown for smeared stringers=  1.4019E+00
Buckling load factor AFTER  knockdown for smeared stringers=  1.3147E+00

General buckling load factor before and after knockdown:
EIGGEN(before modification by 2 factors below)     =1.3147E+00
Knockdown factor from modal imperfection(s)        =9.4144E-01
Knockdown factor for smearing rings on cyl. shell  =7.7761E-01

Final buckling load factor from closed-form PANDA theory =    9.6249E-01

Note that there is a knockdown factor for modal imperfection(s) even though
in this particular example the shell is perfect. Why? Because the ratio,
(ARBOCZ/PANDA2) is equal to 0.94144. The ratio, (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) is the ratio
of buckling loads from ARBOCZ theory [13] to PANDA-type (closed form) theory [41]
for general buckling of a perfect cylindrical shell.

After knockdown, EIGENVALUE = 9.6249E-01. This buckling load factor should
be compared to those predicted from STAGS, given in Fig. 6 (pcr = 1.0222) and
Fig. 7 (pcr = 1.0511). The EIGENVALUE, 9.6249E-01, is the buckling 
load factor from which Margin No. 14 in Table 9 is derived:

margin = (buckling load factor)/(factor of safety) - 1.0 
       = 0.96249/0.999 -1.0 = -3.66E-02.

The most critical general buckling mode from PANDA2 probably would have
corresponded to the (m,n) = (1,3) mode if the knockdown factor for
smearing rings, which depends on the number of circumferential waves in
the buckling mode, had been applied before PANDA2 decided which mode was
the most critical. Then the long-wavelength general buckling mode shape
from STAGS (Fig. 7)  would have agreed with that from PANDA2. However, this
is not the way PANDA2 works, and it is not feasible to change the order
of computations in PANDA2.

The other model of general instability in PANDA2 is the so-called "alternative
buckling theory" in which the buckling load factor is computed from a double
trigonometric series expansion of the buckling modal displacements over a
"patch" of the cylindrical shell [1]. This is the theory from which Margin No.
15 in Table 9 is computed. The mode shape corresponding to the buckling
load factor derived from this alternative buckling theory resembles an
inter-ring buckling mode, although there are components of buckling modal
displacements that give rise to some in-plane bending of the rings. In the
alternative theory model for general buckling the substiffeners are smeared.

The short-wavelength STAGS buckling mode shown in Figs. 6 and 8 seems to be 
a combination of inter-ring buckling of the type covered by PANDA2 in
Margin No. 4 of Table 9,

4  1.03E-02 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=6   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

and general buckling from the alternative theory covered by Margin No. 15 of Table 9,

15  6.26E-04 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

Thus, by the use of several approximate models that cover the same or similar
buckling phenomena, PANDA2 produces margins that guide the design toward
an optimum similar to one that might be produced by STAGS if STAGS were
used in an optimization context.


STAGS MODEL FOR LOCAL BUCKLING

It is best to determine local buckling behavior from a rather small "patch". In
this case the STAGS "patch" includes only one bay between major rings, with a major
ring at each end of the "patch", and three bays between major stringers, with
a major stringer running along each straight edge (generator) of the "patch".
Hence, the "patch" is 37.5 inches long in the axial direction and 43.836 inches
long in the circumferential direction. The major stiffeners that run along the
four boundaries of the "patch" have half the stiffnesses of those that lie
within the "patch". As mentioned previously, all of the substiffeners lie within
the "patch". Figures 1, 12, 13, and 14 show the STAGS "patch" model suitable for a local
buckling survey. The STAGS 480 finite element is used, the reference surface is
the middle surface of the panel skin, and there are fasteners connecting this
reference surface to the roots of all of the stiffeners. The fasteners are seen
as tiny black dots at the stiffener roots shown in Figs. 1, 12, 13, and 14.

The purpose of the STAGS model with use of a small "patch" is to compare predictions
with the various models that PANDA2 uses for the many types of buckling that can
be classified as "local" in this case. The buckling margins from Subcase 1 in
Table 9 that seem to apply best in this context are as follows:

 1  1.24E-01 Local buckling from discrete model-1.,M=2   axial halfwaves;FS=0.99

Many buckling modes were generated via five STAGS runs, each successive run made with use
of a slightly higher eigenvalue "shift" in the STAGS input file, testax4p.bin.
Table 600.32 of [1b] lists the abridged testax4p.out2 files from each of the five STAGS
executions. Figure 1 shows the buckling mode and eigenvalue (buckling load factor)
corresponding to the critical (lowest) buckling load, 0.98903. Figures 12 - 14 show
selected higher buckling modes, modes that display especially well some of the
idealized buckling modes of the type computed by PANDA2 and listed above and in Table 9.


DESCRIPTION OF PANDA2 MODELS OF VARIOUS MODES OF LOCAL BUCKLING

Table 600.33 in [1b] is analogous to Table 600.30 in [1b]. Table 600.33 in [1b]
lists output from PANDA2 corresponding to thirteen models of local
buckling that PANDA2 includes as design constraints. The local buckling modes
from STAGS listed in Table 600.32 of [1b] are combinations of the simplified buckling
models listed in Table 600.33 of [1b] This table is too long to include here.
As with Table 600.30 in [1b] its information should be absorbed by researchers
interested in using PANDA2.

Figures 1 and 12 - 14 show selected buckling modes from the STAGS "patch" model.
Figure 1 shows buckling of the panel skin and substiffeners together with some
deformation of the major stringers, a mode covered by PANDA2 margins 1 and 24.
Figure 12 shows mainly buckling between subrings with
subring rolling and substringers participating in the buckling mode. This type
of buckling is covered by PANDA2 margins 26 and 27.
Figure 13 shows mainly rolling of the stringers, a mode covered by PANDA2 Margin
No. 17. Figure 14 displays a combination of local buckling modes covered by PANDA2
margins 21, 22, and 25.


OPTIMUM DESIGN INCLUDING INITIAL BUCKLING MODAL IMPERFECTION

A general buckling modal imperfection with amplitude Wimpg2 equal to 1.0 inch
is assumed. The case is the same as before except it is called "testax4"
instead of "testax4p" (the "p" in testax4p is for "perfect").

The testax4.BEG and testax4.DEC files, listed in [1b], are the same as those for testax4p.
The new testax4.OPT file is listed in Table 600.35 of [1b]. There are
two load cases, the first with a positive general buckling modal imperfection (+1.0 inch)
and the second with a negaive general buckling modal imperfection (-1.0 inch).

The optimum design is listed in Column 4 of Table 3. This optimum design
was obtained via the runstream listed in Table 4.

In order to obtain a new (close) optimum design that is suitable for
analysis by STAGS, we must ensure that there are integral numbers of equally spaced  major
stiffeners over the entire shell and integral numbers of equally spaced substiffeners
between adjacent major stiffeners, just as we did with the perfect shell (testax4p).
The final optimum design suitable for analysis
by STAGS is listed in the third column of Table 8.
As before, this optimum design is obtained with the use of two load cases:
the first with an initial general buckling modal imperfection with amplitude Wimpg2 = +1.0
inch and the second with imperfection amplitude Wimpg2 = -1.0 inch. The margins
corresponding to Load Case 1, Subcase 1 are listed in Table 12.

In the STAGS runs the imperfection is not present. If we wish to
compare the behavior of the newly optimized shell with the imperfection
neglected, we must execute PANDAOPT again for the same design, this time
with the imperfection amplitude set equal to zero. This was done and the
new margins for Load Case 1, Subcase 1 are listed in Table 13.

PANDA2 generates two estimates of general buckling, one from a PANDA-type
(closed form) theory (Margin No. 16 in Load Set 1, Subcase 1 in Table 12 
and Margin No. 14 in Load Set 1, Subcase 1 in Table 13) and the other from
the alternative, double trigonometric series expansion, theory (Margin No. 17
in Load Set 1, Subcase 1 in Table 12 and Margin No. 15 in Load Set 1,
Subcase 1 in Table 13). These margins are given by

Including the initial general buckling modal imperfection (Table 12, Wimp=1.0 inch):
16  8.71E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=2;slope=20.;FS=0.999 (PANDA-type)
17  6.27E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999    (alternative)

Neglecting the initial buckling modal imperfection (Table 13, Wimp=0.0):
14  1.46E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=2;slope=20.;FS=0.999 (PANDA-type)
15  5.03E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999    (alternative)

Note that the initial general buckling modal imperfection has a much smaller
influence on the buckling margin derived from the PANDA-type (closed form) theory
(Margin 16 with the imperfection and Margin 14 without the imperfection)
than on the buckling margin derived from the alternative (double trig series expansion)
theory (Margin 17 with the imperfection and Margin 15 without the imperfection).

This difference in behavior is explained by Table 600.42 in [1b]. In the PANDA-type (closed
form) model the redistribution of stress from stiffeners to skin during prebuckling
bending of the imperfect shell has no influence on the predicted buckling load or mode 
because all stiffeners are smeared out in the PANDA-type model. Hence, this simplified
theory makes use only of the overall applied stress resultants which are the same
whether there is or is not an initial imperfection. In the alternative theory, in which
the major stiffeners are treated as discrete beams and only the substiffeners are
smeared out, the redistribution of stress from major stiffeners to skin-with-smeared-
substiffeners during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell does have an
influence on the predicted buckling load and mode shape. This influence is apparent
from the output from PANDA2 listed in Table 600.42 in [1b] and from a comparison
of Margin No. 17 with Margin No. 15 listed just above.


RESULTS FROM STAGS FOR THE CASE testax4 WITH IMPERFECTION ABSENT

The STAGS model includes the entire shell. The major
stiffeners are treated as shell units, the substiffeners are smeared, and
the STAGS "480" finite element is used. The middle surface of the panel
skin is the reference surface and there are fasteners connecting this
reference surface to the roots of the major stiffener webs.

Figure 15 shows the general instability buckling mode from the STAGS model with
only the substiffeners smeared, and Fig. 16 shows the same mode with all stiffeners
(major and sub) smeared. Note that smearing the major stiffeners raises the buckling load
factor from 1.2410 to 1.6193, more than 30 per cent. Even though the critical general
buckling mode is smooth (has long wavelengths) a model in which the major stiffeners
are smeared yields an unacceptably unconservative prediction for general buckling.

With use of the 410 finite element rather than the 480 finite element in the model
with all stiffeners (major and sub) smeared out, STAGS obtains eigenvalue=1.6953
for the first pair of modes, which correspond to n = 3 circumferential waves,
and 1.7260 for the second pair of modes, which correspond to n = 2 circumferential
waves. The buckling load factors corresponding to n = 3 and n = 2 are close to
eachother.

With neglect of the initial general buckling modal imperfection, PANDA2 obtains the
following general buckling margin (from Table 13):

14  1.46E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=2;slope=20.;FS=0.999

(buckling load factor = (buckling margin + 1.0)*(factor of safety, FS).
 buckling load factor = (0.146 + 1.0)*(0.999) = 1.4485)

The PANDA2 prediction is about eight per cent conservative compared to the STAGS
prediction, and PANDA2 predicts buckling with two rather than three circumferential
waves. The PANDA2 buckling load factor for general buckling is computed as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EIGMNC=  1.92E+00  1.92E+00  1.94E+00  3.67E+00  1.94E+00  1.92E+00  1.00E+17<--closed form

A second STAGS model includes three major ring bays and nine
major stringer bays for the case called testax4. All the stiffeners, major
as well as sub, are treated as shell units, there are fasteners, and the
STAGS "480" finite element is used. This is the same type of model as that
used for the optimized perfect shell and shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 17 shows the third buckling mode from the STAGS 3 x 9 bay "patch" model.
The third mode rather than the first is shown because the modal deformations
show up better in the plot. (The first three eigenvalues are practically identical).

A third STAGS model includes one major ring bay and three 
major stringer bays for the case called testax4. All the stiffeners, major
as well as sub, are treated as shell units, there are fasteners, and the
STAGS "480" finite element is used. This is the same type of model as that
used for the optimized perfect shell and shown in Figs. 1 and 12-14.

Figures 18 and 19 show buckling modes from the STAGS 1 x 3 bay "patch". The buckling
mode corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue, 1.23892, is displayed in Fig. 18, and
the buckling mode corresponding to the 17th eigenvalue, 1.424294, is displayed in
Fig. 19. Figure 18 is a combination of the PANDA2 modes from Table 13,

RESULTS FOR A SIMILAR STIFFENED SHELL WITHOUT SUBSTIFFENERS

The name of the case for the externally T-stiffened cylindrical shell
with the same overall dimensions (Table 1) 
but without any substiffeners is "testax3". It is of interest to
optimize this shell and to compare the optimized weights of perfect
and imperfect shells without substiffeners with the optimized weights
of perfect and imperfect shells with substiffeners.

There are two inequality conditions in testax3.DEC (Table 600.51 in [1b] not present in the
preceeding cases, testax4p and testax4, in which substiffeners are present. The first
of these two new inequality constraints requires that the width of the flange of
the T-ring be less than the ring spacing. The second new inequality constraint
requires that the spacing of the T-stringers be less than five times the
spacing of the T-rings. After several preliminary optimizations it became
clear that these two additional inequality conditions were required for the
following reasons:

1. to prevent impossible designs in which the rings become so closely spaced
or their outstanding flanges so wide that the outstanding flanges overlap.

2. to prevent "bombs" from SUPEROPT caused by a requirement that for an
IQUICK = 0 type of analysis the stringers must be closer together than
a distance equal to five times the ring spacing. This condition is
built into PANDA2; the user has no choice. When it is violated SUPEROPT
bombs because PANDA2 demands a change of model from IQUICK = 0 to
IQUICK = 1 and then exits from the mainprocessor.

The difficulties leading to the need for these two new inequality constraints
arise because, without any substiffeners present, optimum designs tend to
correspond to configurations in which the T-shaped stiffeners are close together.

The optimum design of the perfect shell is listed in the fifth column of Table 3.
This optimum results from the runstream listed in Table 4.
The fourth column of Table 8 lists the optimum design of the perfect
shell without substiffeners that is suitable for analysis by STAGS
(integral numbers of equally spaced stringers and rings over the entire
shell). The corresponding margins for Load case 1, Subcase 1 are listed in Table 14.


COMPARISON OF THE OPTIMIZED DESIGNS OF THE PERFECT SHELLS WITH AND WITHOUT SUBSTIFFENERS

The weights of the optimized perfect shells with and without substiffeners
are listed in columns 3 and 5, respectively, of Table 3.

It is disappointing that the difference in optimized weights of
the perfect cylindrical shells with and without substiffeners
is insignificant.
For the optimized perfect cylindrical shell with substiffeners the weight
of the shell skin plus the weight of the substiffeners is close to
the weight of the shell skin in the optimized cylindrical shell
without substiffeners. The weights of the major stringers and the
weights of the major rings are approximately the same in the two
cases. It is not worthwhile including substiffeners just to save weight.

However, substiffeners may be considered if it is important that
the number of major stringers be minimized. The spacing of the major
stringers in the optimized cylindrical shell with substiffeners is
given in Table 3 by B(STR) = 14.775 inches. In contrast, the spacing of
the stringers in the optimized cylindrical shell without substiffeners is
B(STR) = 5.2141 inches.

There is a somewhat less dramatic effect on the spacing of the major rings:
39.157 B(RNG):major ring spacing  perfect shell WITH substiffeners
22.208 B(RNG):major ring spacing  perfect shell WITHOUT substiffeners.

Optimized designs of the perfect, externally T-stiffened cylindrical 
shells with and without substiffeners were determined for a range of
spacing of the major stringers. The results are shown in Fig. 20, generated
via a plotting routine "plotps" written by W. D. Bushnell [1].
From Fig. 20 one can see that the weight of the optimized
cylindrical shells without substiffeners is much more sensitive
to spacing of the major stringers than is the case for the
optimized cylindrical shells with substiffeners. This seems to
be the only advantage of adding substiffeners of rectangular cross
section to the panel skin. 

Other loadings, such as external hydrostatic compression (Nx = p*r/2;
Ny = p*r) and load combinations with more in-plane shear Nxy, were
investigated with the same conclusion: there is very little if any
advantage of adding substiffeners of rectangular cross section in order
to decrease minimum weight as long as the stringer spacing is permitted to vary
widely during optimization cycles. Also, the advantage of adding substiffeners
of rectangular cross section disappears if stresses become critical.

Different conclusions might be drawn if the substiffeners have other than
rectangular cross section. PANDA2 is not yet capable of handling
substiffeners with non-rectangular cross sections.  Also, it may be
that adding substiffeners to other parts of the structure than the panel
skin would be advantageous. Perhaps lighter-weight shells could be
made if substiffeners were added to webs and outstanding flanges of the
major stiffeners. There are no plans at this time to expand PANDA2's
capability to handle these new geometries.


RESULTS FROM STAGS FOR THE OPTIMIZED PERFECT SHELL WITHOUT SUBSTIFFENERS

The fourth column of Table 8 lists the optimum design of the perfect
shell without substiffeners that is suitable for analysis by STAGS
(integral numbers of equally spaced stringers and rings over the entire
shell). The corresponding margins for Load case 1, Subcase 1 are listed in Table 14.

The PANDA2 processor STAGSUNIT was used to generate a STAGS model corresponds to a "patch"
that includes three ring bays and nine stringer bays. The middle surface
of the panel skin is the reference surface and there are fasteners that
connect the roots of the stiffener webs to this reference surface (tiny
black dots in Fig. 21). The critical buckling mode for the "patch" is
displayed in Fig. 21. This mode is similar in character to the buckling modes
shown for a similar "patch" of the optimized perfect shell with substiffeners
in Figs. 3-5.

An endview plot of the same buckling mode appears in Fig. 22, which
shows clearly that there are five circumferential halfwaves
in the nine-stringer-bay "patch". This patch spans 47.124 inches of shell
circumference [9 x (B(STR)=5.236 in Col. 4 of Table 8) = 47.124 inches].
The 47.124-inch-wide "patch" represents 1/13.333th of the 360-degree shell circumference.
Hence, the same buckling pattern over the entire circumference would have 66.667
half waves over 360 degrees or about 33 halfwaves over 180 degrees. This mode is in
very good agreement with that predicted by PANDA2 for inter-ring buckling from the
PANDA-type (closed form) analyis (PANDA2 buckling mode type 5 listed in Table 14):

 5  1.57E-01 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=32  circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

STAGSUNIT was used to generate a STAGS model of the optimized, perfect, complete
cylindrical shell. The T-shaped stringers and T-shaped rings are modelled as shell
units, and the STAGS "480" finite element is used. The outer surface of the shell
skin is used as the reference surface and there are no fasteners.
At the optimum design of the perfect
shell the T-shaped stringers are very closely spaced; there are 120 of them over
the entire (360-degree) circumference. There are 15 T-rings over the 300-inch
length of the cylindrical shell. Since each T-shaped stringer consists of
two shell units and each T-shaped ring consists of two shell units, there are
1 + (2 x 120) + (2 x 15) = 271 shell units in this very large STAGS model. This
STAGS model has about 580000 degrees of freedom.

The STAGS model predicts general buckling in a mode with three circumferential
waves at a load factor of 1.060638. This general buckling mode corresponds to
the 25th eigenvalue. Figure 23 shows the general buckling mode from STAGS.

All the other eigenvalues correspond to inter-ring buckling
in which the stringers bend. The lowest eigenvalue (buckling load factor) is 1.0512.
The corresponding buckling mode is displayed in Fig. 24. It was difficult to
find the one general buckling mode hidden like a needle in a haystack among a
thicket of short-wavelength buckling modes of the type shown in Fig. 24. (See
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS).

With the stringers and rings smeared out and with use of the 480 finite element,
the lowest eigenvalue corresponds to general buckling at a load factor of 1.170279,
an increase of about 10 per cent over that for the more accurate model: 1.060638.
The general buckling mode is the same as that found for the STAGS model in which
all stiffener parts were modelled as shell units. With use of the 410 finite
element in the smeared stiffener model the lowest eigenvalue increases from that
computed with use of the 480 element, eigenvalue=1.170279, to eigenvalue=1.194869.

Note that for this shell without substiffeners, in which the T-shaped stringers
and T-shaped rings are more closely spaced than is the case for the optimized shell
with substringers, the degree of unconservativeness caused by smearing the major
stiffeners is significantly less than for the optimized shell with substringers.
In those cases (testax4p for the perfect shell and testax4 for the imperfect
shell) smearing the major stiffeners raises the buckling load factor for
general instability from 1.0511 to 1.2883 for the optimized PERFECT shell with
substiffeners and from 1.2410 to 1.6193 for the optimized IMPERFECT shell
with substiffeners.

Notice in Table 14 that the margin corresponding to general buckling from
the closed-form PANDA-type theory [41],

13 -3.53E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=8;N=0;slope=0.335;FS=0.999

shows that the critical buckling mode from PANDA2 has (m,n) = (MWAVEX,NWAVEX) = (8,0)
halfwaves in the (axial, circumferential) directions. This is similar to the
critical general buckling mode from PANDA2 discussed at some length for the optimized
perfect shell with substiffeners. In that case PANDA2 predicts the critical (m,n) = (6,0).
As with the optimized shell with substiffeners, in the present case the critical
long-wavelength general buckling mode predicted by STAGS
for the shell without substiffeners, shown in Fig. 23, is very different from that
predicted by PANDA2. According to STAGS the critical long-wavelength buckling mode
has one axial halfwave and three circumferential waves.

For the optimized perfect shell without substiffeners PANDA2 yields the following
results from the exhaustive search over (m,n,slope) = (MWAVEX,NWAVEX,SLOPEX) space:

EIGMNC=  1.30E+00  1.30E+00  1.27E+00  1.54E+00  1.35E+00  1.30E+00  1.00E+17
SLOPEX=  2.77E+00  2.77E+00  3.35E-01  1.32E-01  0.00E+00  2.77E+00  0.00E+00
MWAVEX=    1         1         8         8         9         1         0
NWAVEX=    3         3         0         4         1         3         0

Notice that the buckling load factors, EIGMNC for (m,n,slope) = (1,3,2.77)
and (8,0,0.335) are close: EIGMNC = 1.30 and 1.27, respectively. As mentioned in this
context previously, if the knockdown factor for smearing rings had been
applied before PANDA2 chooses which mode is critical, PANDA2's prediction
of buckling mode shape probably would have agreed with that from STAGS.
What is important in this computation of buckling is not the buckling mode shapes
but the buckling load factors. They are what control the evolution of the
design of the perfect shell during optimization cycles.


RESULTS FOR THE OPTIMIZED IMPERFECT SHELL WITHOUT SUBSTIFFENERS

The optimum design resulting from the runstream listed in Table 4 is listed
in the last column in Table 3. The optimum design suitable for analysis by
STAGS is listed in the last column in Table 8. As with the imperfect shells
with substiffeners, the optimum designs without substiffeners were obtained
with application of two load cases:

1. Load Case 1: general buckling modal imperfection amplitude, Wimpg2 = +1.0 inch,
2. Load Case 2: general buckling modal imperfection amplitude, Wimpg2 = -1.0 inch.

The margins corresponding to the optimized design suitable for analysis by STAGS
are listed in Table 15.


COMPARISON OF OPTIMUM DESIGNS OF IMPERFECT EXTERNALLY T-STIFFENED
CYLINDRICAL SHELLS WITH AND WITHOUT SUBSTIFFENERS

As is the case for the perfect optimized shells with substiffeners,
a comparison of the optimum weights of the imperfect shells with and without
substiffeners reveals that the weight saving by introduction of substiffeners
is insignificant. (Compare weights in columns 4 and 6 of Table 3 and columns
3 and 5 of Table 8).

As with the optimized perfect shells with and without substiffeners, the
major stiffeners weigh about the same amount for the optimized imperfect
shells with and without substiffeners. The panel skin for the optimized
imperfect cylindrical shell without substiffeners weighs about 8.3 per cent
more than the skin plus substiffeners of the optimized cylindrical shell
with substiffeners.

The spacing of the major stringers in the optimized imperfect cylindrical
shell with substiffeners is given in Table 3 as B(STR) = 17.782 inches. 
In contrast, the spacing of the major stringers in the optimized imperfect
cylindrical shell without substiffeners is given by B(STR) = 6.665 inches.
Hence, as with the perfect shells, the presence of substiffeners of rectangular
cross section permits the major stringers to be spaced at much wider intervals
around the cylindrical shell.

There is a much less dramatic effect on the spacing of the major rings:

48.508 B(RNG):major ring spacing, imperfect shell with substiffeners
33.480 B(RNG):major ring spacing, imperfect shell without substiffeners.

Probably the spacing of the major rings would be influenced more by the presence of
substiffening for loading by hydrostatic compression, in which the hoop compression
is twice the axial compression, in contrast to the cases explored here, in which
the axial compression is five times the hoop compression.

Note that the optimum design suitable for analysis by STAGS is about 1.5 per
cent lighter than the optimum design obtained with the stiffener spacings free
to change during optimization cycles. (Weight = 21300 lb in Table 8 and
Weight = 21620 lb in Table 3. One naturally asks, "How can the optimum
design with the stiffener spacings held constant be lighter than that found
when the stiffener spacings were allowed to change during optimization cycles?"
or, one might ask, "Why didn't PANDA2 find the "better" (lighter) design when the
stiffener spacings were allowed to change?" There are two answers to this
apparent anomaly:

1. The "better" design listed in col. 5 of Table 8 is actually not better because one
or more of the margins is more negative than for the optimum listed in col. 6 of Table 3.
PANDA2 accepts designs for which no margins are less than -0.05. In this example
one of the margins listed in Table 15,

 7 -4.89E-02 Lo-n Ring sidesway, discrete model, n=7   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

is very close to that limit of acceptability.

2. Often the "global" optimum design is very difficult for PANDA2 to find because
the behavior may change abruptly from design iteration to iteration. For example,
one or more critical buckling mode shapes may change abruptly during optimization
cycles, leading to relatively large excursions of design margins, especially if
a buckling mode shape that represents an initial buckling modal imperfection
changes abruptly. The often "jagged" property of margins in design space makes
it very difficult to find a truly global optimum design.


RESULTS FROM STAGS FOR THE DESIGN LISTED IN COLUMN 5 of Table 8

The linear buckling analysis by STAGS for a three-ring-bay by nine-stringer-bay
"patch" of the  optimized shell
yields a buckling load factor of 1.1428 (initial imperfection
not present in the STAGS model). With the amplitude of the general buckling
modal imperfection set equal to zero, PANDA2 obtains the following margins (among
other margins) for that design:

 5  3.23E-01 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=26  circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999
12  8.04E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999
16  1.44E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=14;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6

The circumferential width of the "patch" in the STAGS model is 60.15816 inches,
which corresponds to 1/10.4444th of the 360-degree circumference of the shell.
The lowest buckling load factor from STAGS, 1.1428, is associated with a
buckling mode that has five circumferential halfwaves over the 60.15816-inch
width of the "patch". This mode translates into 5 x 10.4444/2 = 26 full circumferential
waves over the entire 360-degree circumference of the shell. This mode is in
agreement with the buckling mode associated with the 5th margin in the PANDA2
model:

 5  3.23E-01 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=26  circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

which has 26 circumferential halfwaves over 180 degrees of the circumference of
the shell. The three buckling margins from PANDA1, Margins 5, 12, and 16, cover
the type of buckling observed in the STAGS model.


PANELS WITH SUBSTIFFENERS THAT FORM AN ISOGRID

The "substiffener" capability in PANDA2 was extended to include panels
with axial and circumferential major stiffeners and a skin that may be
reinforced by substiffeners of rectangular cross section that form an
isogrid pattern between adjacent major stringers and rings. Results from
optimizations of perfect and imperfect cylindrical shells with external T-shaped
stringers and external T-shaped rings and with external subisogrid stiffening
are given in [1b]. Also presented in [1b] is the improvement to the theory
for local buckling of the triangular piece of panel skin between adjacent
isogrid or subisogrid members. The improved theory includes the contribution
of the isogrid members to the total potential energy, provided that the
cross section of the isogrid members is rectangular.

As with the cases involving axial and circumferential substiffeners, for
the various loadings investigated it was found that there is no weight
saving from introduction of subisogrid stiffening. The optimized weight
of the perfect shell with an external subisogrid is 17392 lb, which is
greater than the optimized weight of the perfect shell with no substiffeners
(16846 lb) and greater than the optimized weight of the perfect shell with
axial and circumferential substiffeners (16712 lb).
The optimized weight of the imperfect shell with
an external subisogrid is 21560 lb, which is less than the
optimized weight of the imperfect shell without substiffeners (21620 lb)
and greater than the optimized weight of the perfect shell with
axial and circumferential substiffeners (20560 lb). 

With subisogrid stiffening the optimum designs have major stiffeners spaced
farther apart than for the optimum designs without any substiffeners, although
the difference in spacing between the case with substiffeners and that without
is less pronounced than for the cases involving axial and circumferential
substiffeners.


OTHER SUBSTIFFENING CONFIGURATIONS

Cases involving substringers and subrings on opposite sides of the panel skin
and involving internal substringers and internal subrings combined with
external major T-shaped stringers and external T-shaped major rings were explored.
Some results are presented in [1b], especially for the case of a perfect cylindrical
shell with external major stringers and major rings and internal substringers and
subrings. The optimzed weight of this perfect cylindrical shell is 16612 lb, slightly
less than the 16712 lb for the optimized weight of the perfect cylindrical shell
with external substringers and subrings.


NONLINEAR COLLAPSE

In the paper, AIAA 2002-1408 [1], nonlinear collapse is computed for a ring and
stringer stiffened cylindrical shell with general and local buckling modal
imperfections. Figures 27 and 28 of that paper show the results from such an
analysis. Collapse occurs because both the general and local imperfections grow
as the load is increased. Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform a similar
analysis in the effort leading to the present paper for the following reasons:

1. The entire shell must be included in the model because there are no planes
of symmetry due to the presence of in-plane shear loading, Nxy = 20000 lb/in.

2. In the example of the optimized imperfect shell without substiffeners, the
T-shaped stiffeners are so close together that a converged finite element model
would contain too many degrees of freedom to capture the local component of
collapse, which is seen as small dimples in Fig. 27 of AIAA Paper 2002-1408 [1].
It was barely possible to compute the general buckling mode from linear theory
for a similar model (Fig. 23). A nonlinear collapse analysis requires far more
computer resources. Also, as Fig. 24 demonstrates, the very large STAGS model is
probably not large enough to capture accurately either inter-ring buckling or
local buckling between adjacent stringers and rings.

3. In the example of the optimized imperfect shell with substiffeners one might
well conduct a nonlinear collapse analysis in a model in which the substiffeners
are smeared, such as that shown in Fig. 15. However, an analysis of this type
would simply be a repeat of the type of study that produced Figs. 27 and 28 in
AIAA Paper 2002-1408. It would not reveal the effect of prebuckling bending of
the globally imperfect shell on the local buckling behavior of panel skin and
substiffeners, such as that displayed in Figs 1, 12, and 14 of the present work.
A model of the complete cylindrical shell that would capture the complex local
behavior of shell skin and substiffeners would require far more
degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) than the approximately 580000 d.o.f. model needed 
to predict the general buckling mode shown in Fig. 23.


CONCLUSIONS

Adding substiffeners of rectangular cross section between major stiffeners does not
lead to significantly lower optimum weights. However, with substiffeners present the
optimum weights correspond to configurations in which the major stiffeners are
spaced farther apart than is the case for optimized cylindrical shells without
substiffeners.

and reran the 580000-degree-of-freedom STAGS model generated by the file listed in
Table 600.62 of [1b] and shown in Figs 23 and 24. Several reruns at different
"eigenvalue shifts" were required in order
to capture the lowest general buckling mode, which was buried like a needle in a
haystack among a thicket of local buckling modes. Each run required about 40 minutes on
the computer. (Dr. Weiler had to use a special computer with enhanced memory and disk
capacities. That computer, a Pentium 4 desktop with two gigabytes of memory, was
available to him only.)

=================================================================================
NOTE: The six inequality expressions provided by the user in DECIDE impose the
following conditions on the optimum design:

1. The stringer spacing must be at least 3 times the substringer spacing.
2. The ring spacing must be at least 3 times the subring spacing.
3. The substringer height must be less than 10 times the substringer thickness.
4. The subring height must be less than 10 times the subring thickness.
5. The major stringer web height must be less than 20 times the major stringer web thickness.
6. The major ring web height must be less than 20 times the major ring web thickness.

ANOTHER NOTE: There is one linking expression: the stringer base width, B2(STR),
must equal 0.1 x (stringer spacing B(STR)). In this case the
stringer base has the same thickness and properties as the skin
between stringers; there are no faying flanges in any of the
cases explored here.

YET ANOTHER NOTE: PANDA2 accepts designs that are "ALMOST FEASIBLE", that is, for
which there may be some slightly negative margins: that is. any margin greater than
-0.05.
