AIAA Paper 2005-1932, 46th AIAA SDM Meeting, Austin, TX, April 2005,


ABSTRACT

The capability of the computer program PANDA2 to generate minimum-weight designs
of stiffened panels and cylindrical shells is enhanced to permit the
adding of substiffeners with rectangular cross sections between adjacent major
stringers and rings. As a result many new buckling margins exist that
govern buckling over various domains and subdomains of the doubly stiffened
panel or shell. These generally influence the evolution of the design during
optimization cycles. The substiffeners may be stringers and/or rings or may
form an isogrid pattern. The effects of local, inter-ring, and general buckling
modal imperfections can be accounted for during optimization. Perfect and
imperfect cylindrical shells with external T-shaped stringers and T-shaped 
rings and with and without substringers and subrings and under combined
axial compression, external pressure, and in-plane shear are optimized
by multiple executions of a "global" optimizer called SUPEROPT. It is found 
that from the point of view of minimum weight there is little advantage of
adding substiffeners. However, with substiffeners present the major stringers
and rings are spaced farther apart at the optimum design than is so when there
are no substiffeners. The weight of a cylindrical shell with substiffeners is much
less sensitive to the spacing of the major T-shaped stringers than is the case
for a cylindrical shell without substiffeners. The optimum designs obtained
by PANDA2 are evaluated by comparisons with buckling loads obtained from a
general-purpose finite element program called STAGS. Predictions from STAGS
agree well with those from PANDA2. 


INTRODUCTION

Local and overall buckling and optimization of panels can be determined 
with the PANDA2 [1], POSTOP [2], VICONOPT [3], and PASCO [4] computer 
programs. These four programs are capable of obtaining optimum designs, 
and PANDA2, POSTOP, and VICONOPT can do so including the effect of 
local postbuckling of the panel skin and/or parts of the stringers.

Other contributions to the field of buckling and postbuckling
of panels include works by Weaver and his colleagues [5-7], Hilburger, 
et al[8], Baruch and Singer [9], the creators of the STAGS general 
purpose program, Almroth, Rankin, Brogan, and Riks [10-12], Arbocz and 
his colleagues [13-15], Stein [16], Leissa [17], Arnold and Parekh
[18], Starnes, Knight, and Rouse [19], Spier [20,21], Khot and Bauld
[22,23], Zhang and Matthews [24], Gurdal and his colleagues [25-30],
Haftka and his colleagues [30-32], Librescu and his colleagues [33-35],
Sridharan and his colleagues [36,37], Myers and Hyer [38], Nemeth [39],
and Noor, Starnes, and Peters [40], to identify but a few in a vast 
literature.


PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER

The purpose of this paper is to report on an enhancement to PANDA2 that 
permits the optimization of flat and/or cylindrical panels and shells 
with the "usual" stringers and rings and also with "substiffeners". 
That is, the skin between the "usual" stringers and rings can be 
further stiffened by additional members, called "substiffeners" in this 
work. The substiffeners must be of rectangular cross section. The 
"usual" stiffeners (stringers and rings) can, as always, have a variety 
of cross sections, such as rectangular, Tee, Jay, Zee, Hat, Truss-Core, 
as described in [1]. The new version of PANDA2 is used to find minimum 
weight designs of cylindrical shells with T-shaped stringers and 
T-shaped rings and with rectangular substringers and subrings. A case 
is also included in which the substiffeners form an isogrid 
(equilateral triangles) between the T-shaped stringers and rings. 
Thermal loading is not included in cases that involve substiffeners. 
Also, local postbuckling is not permitted in such cases. The objective 
of this research is to determine if the minimum-weight designs of 
cylindrical shells with the more complex "double" stiffening scheme are 
significantly lighter than those optimized with just T-shaped stringers 
and T-shaped rings.

If the major stiffeners form an isogrid there cannot be any substiffeners. If there
are substiffeners present, there can be no post-local buckling analysis (no "Koiter"
analysis,[1,45]). There are no discretized single module models of a segment of
panel skin with one substiffener, as with the major stiffeners [1]. In the skin-stringer
and skin-ring discretized modules, the substiffeners are smeared out in the manner
of Baruch and Singer [9]. Hence, in these discretized module models the new
panel "skin" between major stiffeners is the actual panel skin plus smeared
substringers and smeared subrings.

Only the panel skin can have substiffeners.
As of this writing there can be no substiffeners attached to the webs or
outstanding flanges of major stiffeners. The substiffeners cannot be laminated
composite. They are modelled as if they were of a single orthotropic material
with user-specified E1, E2, G, nu, density, and maximum allowable stress components.

No attempt has been made to account properly for THERMAL loading in cases that
have substiffeners.

This paper is a summary of a section of the file called .../panda2/doc/panda2.news
called "Item no. 600" [1b]. Please see that file for details about input data, output
data, and "how to.." directions and suggestions with regard to obtaining optimum designs
with the new version of PANDA2. 


DESCRIPTION OF PANDA2

PANDA2 is a computer program for the minimum weight design of
stiffened, composite, flat or cylindrical, perfect or imperfect panels
and shells subjected to multiple sets of combined in-plane loads,
normal pressure, edge moments, and temperature.  For most
configurations the panels can be locally postbuckled. Previous work
on PANDA2 is documented in [1]. PANDA2 incorporates the theories of
earlier codes PANDA [41] and BOSOR4 [42]. The optimizer used in PANDA2
is called ADS [43,44]. Panels are optimized subject primarily to buckling
and stress constraints.


PANDA2 Processors and Types of Analysis

As described in [1], the PANDA2 system consists of several processors, 
BEGIN, SETUP, DECIDE, MAINSETUP, PANDAOPT, CHOOSEPLOT, CHANGE, 
STAGSMODEL, STAGSUNIT, etc. The functions of these processors
are as follows:

BEGIN	User establishes starting design, material properties,
	prebuckling and buckling boundary conditions.

SETUP	System sets up BOSOR4-type templates for stiffness and load-
	geometric matrices.

DECIDE	User chooses decision variables and bounds and sets up equality
	and inequality constraints.

MAINSETUP	User chooses analysis type,  loading, and solution
		strategies.

PANDAOPT	Analysis type is performed (e.g. optimization).

CHOOSEPLOT	User chooses what to plot.

DIPLOT	        The system obtains plots (postscript files).

CHANGE	        User changes selected variables and constants.

AUTOCHANGE	A new starting design is automatically generated in a
		random manner.

SUPEROPT	An attempt is made to find a global optimum design.

PANEL	A BOSOR4 input file is generated for inter-ring buckling of
	panel skin and stringers, with stringers modelled as flexible shell
	branches.

PANEL2	A BOSOR4 input file is generated for inter-ring buckling of
	panel skin+smeared stringers with rings modelled as flexible shell
	branches.

STAGSMODEL	An input file for STAGS [10-12] is generated (one
		finite element unit, only stringers are permitted).

STAGSUNIT	An input file for STAGS is generated (multiple shell
		units, both stringers and rings are permitted).

CLEANPAN	Delete all files except files containing user-provided
		input data for BEGIN, DECIDE, MAINSETUP, CHANGE, PANEL,	PANEL2, 
		STAGSMODEL and STAGSUNIT.


PANDA2 can be run in five modes:

  	1. optimization
  	2. simple analysis of a fixed design
  	3. test simulation
  	4. design sensitivity
  	5. load-interaction (Nx,Ny), (Nx,Nxy), (Ny,Nxy)


Types of Buckling Included in PANDA2 Before Substiffeners Added

PANDA2 computes general, inter-ring, and local skin buckling loads and
mode shapes. General buckling is buckling in which both stringers (or
isogrid stiffeners) and rings participate; panel (inter-ring)
buckling is buckling between adjacent rings in which stringers (or
isogrid stiffeners) participate but the lines of intersection of ring
web roots with the panel skin do not translate; local buckling is
buckling of the panel skin between adjacent stringers (or isogrid
stiffeners) and rings. PANDA2 includes the following buckling models:

1. A discretized single skin-stringer module. This model is used for 
local buckling, local postbuckling, and wide column buckling of the 
panel region between adjacent rings (transverse stiffeners).

2. Simple models for the buckling of the panel skin and stiffener
segments of the type described in [41]. Typical buckling modes of the
panel skin and stiffeners are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 of [41]. In the 
panel skin the buckling nodal lines are assumed to be straight, as 
shown in Fig. 9 of [41]. This type of buckling model is used in some of
the software written by Arbocz and Hol [13-15] and by Khot and his colleagues
[22,23]. These models are called "PANDA-type (closed form)" in PANDA2
jargon because they are the only ones used in the original PANDA
program [41], which was superseded by PANDA2 [1] many years ago.  Over
the years an elaborate strategy has been developed in order to ensure
that for each type of buckling in this PANDA-type category,
the most critical (lowest) buckling load factor is not missed. The
critical eigenvalue is determined from several searches over various
regions in the (m,n,slope) domain, where m is the number of axial
halfwaves, n is the number of circumferential halfwaves, and
slope is the slope of the buckling nodal lines (non-zero when
there is in-plane shear loading and/or shell wall anisotropy).  More
details are given in the panda2.news file identified in [1].

For sandwich panels and shells PANDA2 computes load factors for
additional types of buckling that only occur for sandwich walls: face
sheet wrinkling, buckling over the diameter of a single cell of a
honeycomb core, and core crimping [1].

Three additional buckling models were fairly recently added to PANDA2 as
described in [1]:

3. Local buckling between adjacent stringers and rings of a cylindrical
or flat panel obtained from a Ritz model in which the buckling modal
displacement components, u, v, w,  are expanded in double trigonometric
series. The local region is assumed to be simply supported on all four
edges.

4. General buckling of a cylindrical panel in which stringers and rings
are treated as discrete beams with undeformable cross sections. Again,
the general buckling modal displacement components, u, v, w, are
expanded in double trigonometric series. The edges of the domain are
assumed to be simply supported and to have discrete stiffeners of half
the user-specified modulus. The domain for this model is a three-bay by
three-bay subdomain of the entire panel.

5. A discretized single module model for a cylindrical panel in which
the ring segments and panel skin-with-smeared-stringers are 
discretized. in this "branched shell" model the cross sections of the 
rings can deform in the buckling mode, since they are subdivided into 
finite elements of the type used in BOSOR4[42].

Buckling loads corresponding to a given type of buckling (such as local
buckling of the skin between stringers or general buckling) may be
computed by more than one model in order to verify results and to
provide appropriate knockdown factors to account for anisotropy,
inherent unconservativeness in smearing stiffeners, the presence of in-
plane shear loading, and variation of in-plane loading within the
domain that buckles. The effect of transverse shear deformation is
accounted for as described in [1].

PANDA2 can optimize imperfect stiffened panels and shells [1]. 
Imperfections are assumed to be in the shapes of the general, 
inter-ring, and local buckling modes obtained from the PANDA-type model 
identified as Item No. 2 above. Imperfections in stiffened panels and 
shells have two major effects:

a. The imperfect panel or shell bends as soon as any loading is 
applied. This bending causes significant redistribution of stresses 
between the panel skin and the various stiffener parts, thus affecting 
significantly many buckling and stress constraints in the optimization 
problem.

b. The "effective" curvature of a cylindrical panel or shell depends on 
the amplitude of the initial imperfection and on the circumferential 
wavelength of the critical buckling mode of the perfect shell. This 
"effective" curvature is larger than the nominal radius of curvature 
because it corresponds to the radius of a typical inward 
circumferential lobe of the initial and subsequently load-amplified 
buckling modal imperfection. In PANDA2 this larger local radius of 
curvature is assumed to be the governing radius in the buckling 
equations pertaining to the imperfect shell.


Local post buckling analysis

An analysis branch exists in which local post buckling of the panel
skin is accounted for [1]. In this branch a constraint condition
that prevents stiffener pop-off is introduced into the optimization
calculations. The postbuckling theory incorporated into PANDA2 is
similar to that formulated by Koiter for panels loaded into the far-
postbuckling regime [45].


Stress constraints

In addition to buckling constraints, PANDA2 computes stress constraints
including local postbuckling deformations and thermal loading by both
curing and applied temperature distributions. For laminated composite
walls PANDA2 generates stress constraints corresponding to maximum
tension along fibers, maximum compression along fibers, maximum tension
transverse to fibers, maximum compression transverse to fibers, and
maximum in-plane shear stress for each different material in a
stiffened panel. For isotropic material PANDA2 generates stress
constraints based on the von Mises effective stress.


Global optimizer called SUPEROPT introduced into PANDA2

Global optimum designs can be obtained with PANDA2 by means of multiple 
sequential executions of a processor called SUPEROPT, which is 
described in more detail in [1]. At intervals during the optimization
process new starting designs are automatically generated as follows:

    y(i) = x(i)[1 + dx(i)], i = 1,2,3...number of decision variables (1)

in which x(i) is the old value of the ith decision variable, y(i) is
the new value, and dx(i) is a random number between -0.5 and +1.5 if the
decision variable is other than a stiffener spacing and a random number
between -1.0 and +1.0 if the decision variable is a stiffener spacing.
The difference in treatment for decision variables that are not
stiffener spacings from those that are results from early experiments
with SUPEROPT. In order to obtain global optimum designs it is almost 
always necessary to execute SUPEROPT several times in succession, not 
just once or twice.


DESCRIPTION OF STAGS

STAGS (STructural Analysis of General Shells) is a finite element code for
general-purpose nonlinear analysis of stiffened shell structures of
arbitrary shape and complexity. Its capabilities include stress,
stability, vibration, and transient analyses with both material and
geometric nonlinearities permitted in all analysis types. Currently a new
version of STAGS, scheduled for release through COSMIC in 1992, is under
development. New enhancements include a higher order thick shell element,
more advanced nonlinear solution strategies, and more comprehensive
post-processing features such as a link with PATRAN [45].

Research and development of STAGS by Brogan, Almroth, Rankin, Stanley,
Cabiness, Stehlin and others of the Computational Mechanics Department of
the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory has been under continuous
sponsorship from U.S. government agencies and internal Lockheed funding
for the past 20 years.  During this time particular emphasis has been
placed on improvement of the capability to solve difficult nonlinear
problems such as the prediction of the behavior of axially compressed
stiffened panels loaded far into their locally postbuckled states. STAGS
has been extensively used worldwide for the evaluation of stiffened panels
and shells loaded well into their locally postbuckled states. See [7], for
example.

A large rotation algorithm that is independent of the finite element
library has been incorporated into STAGS [46].  With this algorithm there
is no artificial stiffening due to large rotations.  The finite elements
in the STAGS library do not store energy under arbitrary rigid-body motion
and the first and second variations of the strain energy are consistent.
These properties lead to quadratic convergence during Newton iterations.

Solution control in nonlinear problems includes specification of load
levels or use of the advanced Riks-Crisfield path parameter that enables
traversal of limit points into the post-buckling regime. Two load systems
with different histories (Load Sets A and B) can be defined and controlled
separately during the solution process. Flexible restart procedures permit
switching from one strategy to another during an analysis.  This includes
shifts from bifurcation buckling to nonlinear collapse analyses and back
and shifts from static to transient and transient to static analyses with
modified boundary conditions and loading.  STAGS provides solutions to the
generalized eigenvalue problem for buckling and vibration from a linear or
nonlinear stress state.

Quadric surfaces can be modeled with minimal user input as individual
substructures called "shell units" in which the analytic geometry is
represented exactly. "Shell units" can be connected along edges or
internal grid lines with partial or complete compatibility.  In this way
complex structures can be assembled from relatively simple units.
Alternatively, a structure of arbitrary shape can be modelled with use of
an "element unit".

Geometric imperfections can be generated automatically in a variety of
ways, thereby permitting imperfection-sensitivity studies to be performed.
 For example,  imperfections can be generated by superposition of several
buckling modes determined from previous STAGS analyses of a given case.

A variety of material models is available, including both plasticity and
creep.  STAGS handles isotropic and anisotropic materials, including
composites consisting of up to 60 layers of arbitrary orientation. Four
plasticity models are available, including isotropic strain hardening, the
White Besseling (mechanical sublayer model), kinematic strain hardening,
and deformation theory.

Two independent load sets, each composed from simple parts that may be
specified with minimal input, define a spatial variation of loading. Any
number of point loads, prescribed displacements, line loads, surface
tractions, thermal loads, and "live" pressure (hydrostatic pressure which
remains normal to the shell surface throughout large deformations) can be
combined to make a load set. For transient analysis the user may select
from a menu of loading histories, or a general temporal variation may be
specified in a user-written subroutine.

Boundary conditions (B.C.) may be imposed either by reference to certain
standard conditions or by the use of single- and multi-point constraints.
Simple support, symmetry, antisymmetry, clamped, or user-defined B.C. can
be defined on a "shell unit" edge.  Single-point constraints which allow
individual freedoms to be free, fixed, or a prescribed non-zero value may
be applied to grid lines and surfaces in "shell units" or "element units".
 A useful feature for buckling analysis allows these constraints to differ
for the prestress and eigenvalue analyses. Langrangian constraint
equations containing up to 100 terms may be defined to impose multi-point
constraints.

STAGS has a variety of finite elements suitable for the analysis of
stiffened plates and shells.  Simple four node quadrilateral plate
elements with a cubic lateral displacement field (called "410" and "411"
elements) are effective and efficient for the prediction of postbuckling
thin shell response.  A linear (410) or quadratic (411) membrane
interpolation can be selected.  For thicker shells in which transverse
shear deformation is important, STAGS provides the Assumed Natural Strain
(ANS) nine node element (called "480" element).  A two node beam element
compatible with the four node quadrilateral plate element is provided to
simulate stiffeners and beam assemblies.  Other finite elements included
in STAGS are described in the STAGS literature [10-12].

NEW ENTRIES IN THE PROMPT.DAT FILE FOR SUBSTIFFENERS

Table 600.1 lists the new prompts in the PROMPT.DAT file. NOTE: Substiffeners are
introduced into a case by the user's answering Prompts 186 and 187 with "Y".

Table 600.1  New prompts in the PROMPT.DAT file for introduction of substiffeners
=================================================================================
186.1 Any more layers or groups of layers in Segment no.
186.2 
      NOTE: the total number of layers permitted is 90. Answer "Y"
            if you want to add substiffeners.

187.1 Does one of the additional layers consist of sub-stiffeners?
187.2
      Answer Y or N.

188.1 Does this sub-stiffener "layer" form an isogrid?
188.2 
      If "Y", then the cross sections of each substiffener member have
      the same dimensions, (TSUB,HSUB), spacings BSUB, and material index,
      MATSUB.

      For an isogrid substiffener assembly the following rules apply:

       a. THSUB(1) = 0.    or
       b. THSUB(1) = 90.  

      With THSUB(1) = 0., one member of the three identical isogrid members
      is oriented axially (the same as the ISOANG=2 choice in the case for
      which the major stiffeners form an isogrid).

      With THSUB(1) = 90., one member of the three is oriented circumferentially,
      (the same as the ISOANG = 1 choice when the major stiffeners form an
      isogrid.

189.0
      A "layer" that has sub-stiffeners consists of up to two sets of
      substiffeners, each set with rectangular cross section. There is no skin
      in this type of "layer", just 1 or 2 sets of uniformly spaced
      substiffeners or a single set forming an isogrid pattern.
      
      These substiffeners are IN ADDITION to any "regular" 
      stiffeners, that is, stringers and/or rings which may have any of several
      different cross sections, such as blades, tees, jays, zees, or hats. The
      substiffeners MUST be of rectangular cross section and have no base
      (no faying flange). 

      You are NOT allowed to "stack" substiffener layers. If you have two
      substiffener "layers" (the most allowed), one "layer" must be attached
      to one side of the already-defined panel skin and the other to the other
      side of the panel skin. (You cannot embed a substiffener "layer" between
      skin layers. In a given panel segment you cannot have one isogrid
      substiffener "layer" and one non-isogrid substiffener "layer".
      
      PANDA2 will next ask you to supply the following data
      [in which i = ith substiffener set (i = 1 or 2) 

      TSUB(i)  = thickness of substiffeners in ith set
                   (dimension parallel to plane of the skin).
      HSUB(i)  = height of substiffeners in ith set
                   (dimension normal to the plane of the skin).
      THSUB(i) = angle (degrees) of substiffeners in ith set
                   (THSUB = 0. means substiffener runs in axial direction; 
                    THSUB =90. means circumferential direction).
      BSUB(i)  = spacing of substiffeners in ith set
                   (BSUB is measured normal to the axis of the substiffener).
      MATSUB(i)= material index of substiffeners in ith set.
      NSURF(i) = index for which skin surface substiffeners are attached to
                   (NSURF = 0 means substiffeners attached to layer no. 1;
                    NSURF = 1 means substiffeners attached to layer no. n).
      NB2(i)   = index for whether substiffeners extend over the B2 region
                   (B2 is the base under the "regular" stiffener.
                    NB2 = 0 means substiffeners do not extend over B2;
                    NB2 = 1 means substiffeners do extend over B2).

      NOTE: The rectangular substiffeners have no thickened bases beneath them
      (no faying flanges). Permissible angles are (0 and 90) degrees.
      In the case of a subisogrid array the angle (0 or 90) that you give
      identifies the orientation of the isogrid (one member axial or one member
      circumferential). In the case of a subisogrid array you are allowed only
      one set of substiffeners, not two sets.

      In the case of substiffener sets oriented either axially or circum-
      ferentially (non-subisogrid array) each set can have its own cross
      section, that is, axially oriented (0-degree) substiffeners can have
      a different rectangular cross section from circumferentially oriented
      (90-degree) substiffeners.

190.1 Index, NSURF = 0 or 1, for substiffener "layer"
190.2 

      NSURF = 0 means substiffener "layer" is attached to top of
                Layer No. 1 of the panel skin. Also, NSURF = 0
                means that the substiffener is attached to the
                same surface as the major stringer. Please see Fig.
                8 on p. 490 of the long 1987 PANDA2 paper,
                "PANDA2- program for minimum weight design..." for
                orientation of a major stringer and panel skin.

      NSURF = 1 means substiffener "layer" is attached to bottom of
                Layer No. NLAYERS of the panel skin. Also, NSURF = 1
                means that the substiffener is attached to the
                opposite surface from the major stringer.

191.1 Index, NB2 = 0 or 1, for substiffener "layer"
191.2 
      NB2 = 0 means substiffener "layer" does NOT extend over either
              the "regular" stringer base or the "regular" ring base.
      NB2 = 1 means substiffener "layer" DOES extend over both the
              "regular" stringer base and the "regular" ring base.

192.1 Thickness, TSUB, of substiffener set
192.2
      Thickness is the dimension parallel to the plane of the panel skin.
      NOTE: The cross section MUST be rectangular.

193.1 Height, HSUB, of substiffener set
193.2
      Height is the dimension normal to the plane of the panel skin.
      NOTE: The cross section MUST be rectangular.

194.1 Angle, THSUB (degrees), of substiffener set
194.2 
      The angle, THSUB (degrees), is measured from the panel axial direction
      (normal to the screen) to the coordinate along the substiffener axis,
      positive in the same sense that a layer layup angle is positive in the
      case of a composite lamina. Note that only THSUB = 0 or 90 are allowed.
      THSUB = 0 means substringers; THSUB = 90 means subrings. In the case of
      a subisogrid array, THSUB determines the orientation of the subisogrid.

195.1 Spacing, BSUB, of substiffener set
195.2 
      Spacing BSUB is measured normal to the substiffener axis.

196.1 Material type, MATSUB,  for substiffener set
196.2 
      Use an integer, just as with material type for a layer
      of the panel skin.

197.1 Are there any more substiffener sets in substiffener "layer"
197.2 
      You are allowed up to two substiffener sets if the substiffener
      layer is NOT an isogrid, one substiffener set in which the
      substiffeners are oriented axially and other substiffener
      set in which the substiffeners are oriented circumferentially.
      Of course, you may also have only one substiffener set, oriented
      either axially or circumferentially.

      For a subisogrid you are allowed only one substiffener "layer". 

198.1 Are there any more substiffener "layers"?
198.2 
      You are allowed AT MOST two substiffener "layers". If you have
      two substiffener "layers", they must be attached to opposite
      sides of the panel skin. You cannot "stack" substiffener layers.
=============================================================================


THEORY AND MODIFICATIONS TO PANDA2 TO PERMIT SUBSTIFFENERS

With the introduction of substiffeners between major stiffeners, there are
many new buckling constraints introduced into the optimization problem,
such as buckling of the panel skin between substiffeners including rolling
of the substiffeners, buckling of the panel skin with smeared substringers
between adjacent subrings, buckling of the substringers, buckling of the
subrings, and buckling from the alternative theory (double trigonometric
series expansions) of various "patches" involving segments of the panel
skin with discrete substiffeners.

These new constraints are generated in PANDA2 by means of new coding that
is analogous to that previously existing for buckling of segments of the
major stiffeners and for buckling of sections of the panel skin stiffened
by major stiffeners. Examples are provided below.

The modifications to PANDA2 software required to implement the new capability
are too numerous to list here. The libraries most significantly modified
are GETCIJ, BUCPAN1, BUCPAN2, TRIANG, and STAGSUNIT. The new buckling
constraints involving substiffeners and segments of the panel skin stiffened
by substiffeners are computed in the modified library, BUCPAN1, specifically
in SUBROUTINE BUCPAN, which contains a new very long section required to
implement the new capability. The new long section in SUBROUTINE BUCPAN does
not involve any new buckling theory; the same subroutines (such as SUBROUTINE
GENSTB) are called in the new section as are called in the previously
existing parts of SUBROUTINE BUCPAN. The various buckling theories used in
PANDA2 are described in the previously existing PANDA2 literature.

NOTE: In the case of a panel with substiffeners that form an isogrid pattern
between adjacent major stringers and rings, a new capability has been implemented
to the coding in the TRIANG library, where buckling of the triangular portion
of panel skin between adjacent isogrid members is computed. Previously, the buckling
theory was based on the assumption that the triangular piece of panel skin
between adjacent isogrid members was simply supported along its three edges.
The contributions of stiffener rolling to the strain energy and work done by
prebuckling stiffener resultants during buckling modal rotations were neglected.
Now, provided that the stiffeners are of rectangular cross section (as is always
the case with substiffeners), these contributions are included. For panels
in which the major stiffeners form an isogrid pattern, if the major stiffeners
are of rectangular cross section, their rolling during buckling modal rotations
is now included. (Remember, if the major stiffeners form an isogrid pattern,
substiffeners are not allowed).

There are new stress constraints that involve the substiffeners.


INPUT DATA FOR THE "BEGIN", "DECIDE", "MAINSETUP/PANDAOPT", "CHANGE" FILES

Table 600.2 lists input data for the PANDA2 processor BEGIN for a case
called "testax4p" which has T-shaped major stringers, T-shaped major rings, 
rectangular substringers and rectangular subrings (Fig. 1). The "panel" is a cylindrical
shell with radius 100 inches, length 300 inches, material aluminum, with the
maximum allowable stress set very high so that stress constraints will not
affect the optimum design. All of the stiffeners are external. Note that

       314.0    $ Panel length in the plane of the screen, L2

The length, L2 = 314.0 inches, is close to pi*r, which represents 180 degrees
of the complete (360 deg.) cylindrical shell. In the absence of significant
in-plane shear loading, Nxy, or significant overall anisotropy, the behavior
of a cylindrical panel that spans 180 degrees of circumference and that is
simply supported along its two generators is the same as that of a complete
(360 deg.) cylindrical shell provided that critical buckling is not axisymmetric
(n=0 circumferential waves).

NOTE: The six inequality expressions provided by the user in DECIDE impose the
following conditions on the optimum design:

1. The stringer spacing must be at least 3 times the substringer spacing.
2. The ring spacing must be at least 3 times the subring spacing.
3. The substringer height must be less than 10 times the substringer thickness.
4. The subring height must be less than 10 times the subring thickness.
5. The major stringer web height must be less than 20 times the major stringer web thickness.
6. The major ring web height must be less than 20 times the major ring web thickness.

ANOTHER NOTE: There is one linking expression: the stringer base width, B2(STR),
              must equal 0.1 x (stringer spacing B(STR)). In this case the
              stringer base has the same thickness and properties as the skin
              between stringers; there are no faying flanges in any of the
              cases explored here.

In this case the stiffened shell is assumed to be perfect. A general buckling
modal imperfection will be introduced later. Note that the loading is given

RUNSTREAM TO OBTAIN THE "GLOBAL" OPTIMUM DESIGN

The runstream to produce a "global" optimum design follows. The case name is "testax4p".
"Global" is in quotes because there is no guarantee that the optimum is truly a global
optimum design. The more sets of "superopt/chooseplot/diplot" the user executes, the
more likely it is that a truly global optimum design will result. In the "global"
optimization in this case, there were four executions of the sequence
SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT.

NOTE: Each execution of SUPEROPT must be followed by an
execution of CHOOSEPLOT because CHOOSEPLOT is where the total number of design
iterations gets reset to zero between executions of SUPEROPT. This must always
be done before the next execution of SUPEROPT.

ANOTHER NOTE: Before you execute SUPEROPT make sure the analysis type, ITYPE, is set
to 1 in the *.OPT file.  Any other value of ITYPE in the *.OPT file will lead to an
infinitely long execution, with PANDA2 repeating the analysis of a fixed design over
and over and over again, forever!

Figure 2 shows a plot of the objective function vs design iterations after
the first execution of SUPEROPT.

Table 600.5 lists input data for the PANDA2 processor CHANGE. The values of
the variables correspond to the optimum design found after four executions
of SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT for the case called testax4p. It is a good idea
for the user ALWAYS to "save" the optimum design via CHANGE so that in the
future it will be easy to reconstruct the optimum design and to get results 
corresponding to that optimum design via the sequential execution of
BEGIN, CHANGE, DECIDE, MAINSETUP, PANDAOPT, STAGSUNIT.

================================================================================

In PANDA2 the new margins involving substiffeners are computed in a manner
analogous to similar margins involving major stiffeners. For example, Margin 21
above is computed from the PANDA-type (closed-form) theory in which the effect of
rolling of the substiffeners along the edges of a local region of skin between
adjacent substiffeners is included. In PANDA2 models with IQUICK=1 (no discretized
skin-stringer module model) and no alternative solution and no substiffeners and
major stiffeners with rectangular cross sections, there is an analogous margin: 

 "buck.(SAND);rolling with local buck.; M=1;N=1;slope=0.2236;FS=1.

computed from the same subroutines.

Margins 22 and 23 are computed from the same subroutines as those for
the analogous margins that involve major stiffeners. For example, the
"old" margin pertaining to a major stringer,

 7  1.76E+00 buckling margin stringer Iseg.3 . Local halfwaves=8  .MID.;FS=1.

is computed in SUBROUTINE STFEIG. (In this particular case there is no buckling
of ring "Iseg.3" because there exists only tension along the axis of the ring web).

The new margins pertaining to a substringer and subring,
 
22 -4.04E-04 buckling:simp-support of substring.M=1;FS=1.
23  1.14E+01 buckling:simp-support of subrings  N=1;FS=1.

are computed from statements taken from SUBROUTINE STFEIG and inserted in
the proper place in SUBROUTINE BUCPAN.

New margins 24, 25,and 27, computed from the alternative buckling theory described in 
the paper, ADDITIONAL BUCKLING SOLUTIONS IN PANDA2, AIAA Paper 99-1233, April, 1999,

24 -2.86E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln4  intermajorpatch; FS=0.999
25  3.21E-01 buckling:simp-support altsoln5  skin+edgsubroll; FS=0.999
27  5.78E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln6  inter-subring  ; FS=0.999

are calculated in the same subroutine, ALTSOL, used for computation of the "old" margins: 

12  1.53E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support smearsubstf; (0.95*altsol);FS=0.999
13 -3.84E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999
15  2.35E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

The new alternative buckling models are analogous to the old. The new margin,

25  3.21E-01 buckling:simp-support altsoln5  skin+edgsubroll; FS=0.999

is analogous to the "old" one,

12  1.53E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support smearsubstf; (0.95*altsol);FS=0.999

In the new margin (Margin 25) the buckling domain is the panel skin between
adjacent substiffeners with rolling of the substiffeners along the edges of
the domain included in the model. In the old margin, (Margin 12) the domain
is the panel skin + smeared substiffeners between adjacent major stiffeners.

The new margin,

27  5.78E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln6  inter-subring  ; FS=0.999

is analogous to the "old" one,

13 -3.84E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999

In the new margin (Margin 27) the buckling domain is the panel skin plus
substringers between subrings. A 6-substringer-bay model is used. In the
"old" margin (Margin 13) the domain is the panel skin + smeared substiffeners
between adjacent major rings. A 6-major-stringer-bay model is now used. (See
panda2,news Item No. 603. Previously it was a 3-major-stringer bay model.)

The new margin,

24 -2.86E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln4  intermajorpatch; FS=0.999

is analogous to the "old" one,

15  2.35E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

In the new margin (Margin 24) the buckling domain is an N-substringer-bay x
M-subring-bay "patch", in which N can be as high as 6 and M can be as
high as 5. In the "old" margin (Margin 15) the buckling domain is an
N-major-stringer bay x M-major-ring-bay "patch", in which N can be as high
as 6 and M can be as high as 5, with substringers and subrings smeared.
(See panda2.news Item No. 603 for the recent modification of the way
in which the "old" Margin 15 is now computed with a larger "patch" than
was previously used. The old "patch" had 3-major-ring bays x 3-major-stringer
bays.) 

The two new margins pertaining to substiffeners,

28  5.77E+00 buck.(SAND);rolling with smear subrng;M=39;N=1;slope=0.01;FS=0.999
29  6.91E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling only of substring;M=20;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6

are analogous to the two "old" margins pertaining to major stiffeners:

16  5.72E+00 buck.(SAND);rolling with smear rings; M=52;N=1;slope=0.01;FS=0.999
17  6.94E-03 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=16;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6

The two new margins pertaining to substiffeners,

26  2.18E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling with smear substr;M=1;N=2;slope=16.67;FS=0.999
30  8.00E+00 buck.(SAND);rolling only of subrings; M=0;N=4;slope=0.;FS=1.6

are analogous to similar "old" margins pertaining to major stiffeners. However,
the "old" margins, although computed, are not recorded as constraints on the
design because they are both superceded by the discretized skin-with-smeared-
stringers/ring single module model that yields the margin,

 4  2.53E-02 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=6   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

With the NPRINT index set equal to 2 in the *.OPT file, PANDA2 prints messages
such as the following:

 Inter-ring buckling with smeared stringers and ring rolling
 is not recorded as a margin because this type of buckling
 has been superceded by the results from the discretized
 inter-ring module model, for which inter-ring buckling
 load factors have been computed in the range from n =     1
 to n =    70 circumferential halfwaves.
 The critical inter-ring-buckling-with-ring-rolling model has    7
 circ. half waves, which lies within this range.

 Ring rolling without participation of the panel skin
 is not recorded as a margin because this type of buckling
 has been superceded by the results from the discretized
 "skin"-ring module model, for which buckling load factors
 have been computed in the range from n =     1 to n =    70 circ. halfwaves.
 The critical ring-rolling-without-participation-of-the-panel-skin model has    7
 circ. half waves, which lies within this range.

Please see panda2.news Item No. 463 for more about the discretized module
model that involves the panel skin with smeared major stringers and a single
discretized major ring cross section and how this model supercedes several
buckling constraints that involve major ring rolling. Note that there exists no
analogous discretized skin-with-smeared-substringers/subring module model.
Therefore, margins such as Margin No. 26 and Margin No. 30 are recorded and
not superceded by any other buckling model.

Table 600.10 lists margins in which the substringers and subrings are smeared
in the manner of Baruch and Singer [].

Margins 1 - 3:

 1  2.53E-02 Local buckling from discrete model-1.,M=2   axial halfwaves;FS=0.99
 2  2.23E-01 Bending-torsion buckling; M=2  ;FS=0.999
 3  3.24E-01 (m=2   lateral-torsional buckling load factor)/(FS)-1;FS=0.999

are from the discretized "skin"-major-stringer single module model. In
Margin 1 the term "local" means "local buckling of the "skin" between major
stringers. In the presence of substiffeners, what used to be called the panel
skin is now the panel skin with smeared substiffeners. Margins 2 and 3 are
computed from the same discretized single module model with smeared substiffeners.

With substiffeners present there exist buckling modes more local than that
corresponding to Margin 1. For example, the margin, 

21  4.60E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling with skin buckl.; M=1;N=1;slope=0.1939;FS=0.999

involves local buckling of the panel skin between adjacent substiffeners, with
rolling of the substiffeners included in the model.

Margins 4 and 13,

 4  2.53E-02 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=6   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999
13 -3.84E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999

are computed with substiffeners smeared and major stringers smeared.

Margin 12,

12  1.53E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support smearsubstf; (0.95*altsol);FS=0.999

used to be called "buck.(SAND);simp-support local buckling; (0.95*altsol)". It
is generated from the same alternative buckling theory (double trigonometric series
expansion) as before when there existed only skin between adjacent stringers and
rings. Now the domain between adjacent major stringers and rings includes smeared
substiffeners.

Margins 14 and 15,

14 -2.02E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=6;N=0;slope=0.4637;FS=0.999
15  2.35E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

are derived from two different models of general instability, a closed form
PANDA-type model in which all stiffeners (major and sub) are smeared out (Margin 14)
and an alternative (double trig series expansion) model in which the substiffeners
are smeared out and the major stiffeners are treated as discrete beams in a
6-major stringer bay by 5-major-ring-bay "patch" (Margin 15).

Margin 16,

16  5.72E+00 buck.(SAND);rolling with smear rings; M=52;N=1;slope=0.01;FS=0.999

is generated from a model in which the substiffeners as well as the major rings
are smeared out and the major stringers are treated as discrete beams that run
along the two generators at the straight edges of the long, narrow domain that
includes the entire length of shell between two adjacent major stringers.


GENERATING AN OPTIMUM DESIGN THAT CAN BE ANALYZED WITH STAGS

It is important to evaluate the optimum design obtained by PANDA2 by use of
a general-purpose finite element program operating on the same design. The
general-purpose finite element program STAGS [ ] was used. The PANDA2 processor
STAGSUNIT [ ] had to be modified to work for panels with substiffeners.

In order to generate a PANDA2 model that, via STAGSUNIT, produces suitable input
files, *.bin and *.inp, for STAGS, it is necessary first to find an optimum design
with PANDA2 in which there are integral numbers of major stiffeners over the entire 
domain of the STAGS model and integral numbers of substiffeners between adjacent
major stiffeners. This is done via the following runstream:

=======================================================================================

CREATION OF STAGS MODELS

STAGS models, such as that shown in Fig. 1, are generated via the PANDA2 processor 
called STAGSUNIT. The purpose of STAGSUNIT is to generate the two input files,
*.bin and *.inp, for the STAGS general purpose finite element program. In this
example "*" stands for the case name, "testax4p".

As described in the paper,

D. Bushnell and C. Rankin, "Optimization of perfect and imperfect ring and
stringer stiffened cylindrical shells with PANDA2 and evaluation of the optimum
designs with STAGS", AIAA Paper 2002-1408, pp 1562-1613 Proceedings of the
43rd AIAA SDM Meeting, April, 2002,

the processor STAGSUNIT is written in such a way that "patches" of various portions 
of a complete panel or shell can be analyzed with STAGS. The correct prebuckled
state of a perfect panel is preserved independently of the size of the "patch"
to be included in the STAGS model. The minimum size "patch" must contain at
least one major stiffener spacing in each direction, and major stringers are
always included along the two straight edges of the "patch".

Stiffeners that run along the four boundaries of the "patch" have half the
stiffness of those that lie within the "patch". With stiffened panels there
are always major stringers that run along the two straight edges of the "patch".
There may or may not be rings running along the two curved edges of the "patch",
depending on input to STAGSUNIT provided by the user of PANDA2.

Substiffeners always lie within the patch. There are always integral numbers
of substiffeners (substringers and/or subrings) between adjacent major
stiffeners. The substiffeners that are closest to the major stiffeners are
one half a substiffener spacing away from the major stiffeners. Substringers
and subrings never occur along coordinate lines where there exist major
stringers and/or major rings. As of this writing STAGSUNIT cannot handle
isogrid stiffening or substiffening.

The STAGS models are constructed by the PANDA2 processor STAGSUNIT in such a
way that all stiffeners (major and sub) are connected only to the panel skin.
That is, where stiffeners intersect they simply pass through eachother with
no constraints between them along their lines of intersection. This is a
conservative model with respect to buckling. There can be gaps between the
roots of the stiffeners and the reference surface of the panel skin. For
example, if the reference surface of the panel skin is the middle surface,
there are gaps equal to half the skin thickness. The user can elect to have
what in STAGS jargon are called "fasteners" that relate the nodal displacement
components on the skin reference surface to those at the root of a stiffener
web. The STAGS model shown in Fig. 1 has fasteners. They can barely be seen
as tiny black dots at nodal points along the roots of all the stiffeners.

In order to handle substiffeners the processor STAGSUNIT had to be modified.
Table 600.14 lists new entries pertaining to STAGSUNIT in the file called
PROMPT.DAT, which contains prompts and "help" paragraphs for the PANDA2 user.

Table 600.15 lists typical input data to be provided by the PANDA2 user
during a STAGSUNIT interactive session. In this example, as before, the optimized
shell is a complete (360-deg) cylindrical shell 300 inches long with a
radius of 100 inches. The "patch" to be included in this particular STAGS model
contains three major ring bays (axial length = 3 x 37.5 = 112.5 inches) and nine
major stringer bays (circumferential length = 9 x 14.612 = 131.50853 inches). All
stiffeners, major and sub, are modelled as shell units in this particular model.
The STAGS "480" finite element is used. The middle surface of the cylindrical
skin is the reference surface and there are fasteners that connect this
reference surface to the stiffener roots. A buckling mode of the STAGS model
is shown in Fig. 3.

RESULTS FROM STAGS

The execution of STAGS produces a number of files. The user must inspect the *.out1 and
*.out2 files if the STAGS run bombs. The user must inspect the *.out2 file if the run
finishes in a normal fashion.

Table 600.16 lists the most important part of the testax4p.out2 file generated from the 
successful STAGS run to which Table 600.15 corresponds: a three-axial-bay by nine-
circumferential-bay "patch" in which all of the major stiffeners and substiffeners
are modelled as shell units and in which the "480" STAGS finite element is used
throughout the STAGS model. The middle surface is used as the reference surface of the
cylindrical skin and there exist fasteners that connect this middle surface to the
roots of the stiffeners (Fig. 3).

The buckling modes corresponding to the eigenvalues (buckling load factors) listed
in Table 600.16 are all mixtures of the types corresponding to the following margins
from PANDA2 (Table 600.13):

 1  1.24E-01 Local buckling from discrete model-1.,M=2   axial halfwaves;FS=0.99
 2  3.38E-01 Bending-torsion buckling; M=2  ;FS=0.999
 3  4.50E-01 (m=2   lateral-torsional buckling load factor)/(FS)-1;FS=0.999
 4  1.03E-02 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=6   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999
13 -3.76E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999
17 -2.58E-02 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=14;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6
24 -4.18E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln4  intermajorpatch; FS=0.999


Table 600.16 Abridged and edited version of the output file, testax4p.out2 from STAGS.
             All stiffeners (major and sub) are shell units and the 480 element is used.
             The "patch" model includes three major ring bays and nine major
             stringer bays (Fig. 3).
             NOTE: The numbers listed under "TYPES OF BUCKLING" correspond to the PANDA2
             margins from Table 600.13 and repeated just above.

According to PANDA2, the three types of buckling

 1  1.24E-01 Local buckling from discrete model-1.,M=2   axial halfwaves;FS=0.99
 2  3.38E-01 Bending-torsion buckling; M=2  ;FS=0.999
 3  4.50E-01 (m=2   lateral-torsional buckling load factor)/(FS)-1;FS=0.999

are not critical. In contrast, these three modes play a prominant role in the STAGS 
model of buckling. In PANDA2 the domain used for these three types of buckling includes
only the axial dimension between adjacent major rings. Therefore, the string "M=2" means
"two axial halfwaves between major rings". In the STAGS model the axial wavelength of
the "bending-torsion" buckling or "lateral-torsional" buckling (sidesway of the major
stringers) is not restricted to the distance between adjacent major rings because
the stiffeners are allowed to deform relative to eachother where they intersect. The
PANDA2 model that leads to the margin,

17 -2.58E-02 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=14;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6

also allows the stringers to deform relative to the major rings because the domain
is the entire axial length of the panel. Therefore, the string "M=14" means "14
axial halfwaves over the entire axial length of the panel". The inclusion of this
type of buckling prevents PANDA2 from yielding an unconservative design in this
case because the buckling domain is longer than one major ring spacing.

Figure 3 shows the buckling mode from STAGS corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue
(buckling load factor), 0.97738.

Table 600.17 in ITEM No. 600 of [..panda2/doc/panda2.news] lists the input data
for STAGSUNIT for the same geometry except that
the "410" STAGS finite element is used rather than the "480" finite element.

STAGS produces the following results:

             All stiffeners (major and sub) are shell units and the 410 element is used.

The buckling modes from STAGS are essentially the same as those corresponding
to the STAGS model in which the "480" finite element was used (Table 600.16).

Table 600.19 of ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists the input data for STAGSUNIT for the same geometry except
that the substiffeners are modelled as beams ("210" finite elements) rather
than as shell units. The "410" shell element is used. NOTE: If any stiffeners
(major or sub) are modelled as beams (210 element), then the user has no
choice: the STAGS 410 element MUST be used for all shell units.

STAGS produces the following results:

             The substiffeners are beams and the major stiffeners are shell units.

Figure 4 shows the buckling mode from STAGS corresponding to the lowest
eigenvalue (buckling load factor).

The buckling modes from STAGS are similar to those corresponding
to the STAGS models in which the substiffeners are treated as shell units
except that there is little evidence of the type of buckling from PANDA2's
margin 24: "intermajorpatch".

Table 600.21 of ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists the input data for STAGSUNIT for the same geometry except 
that the substiffeners are smeared out rather than being treated as discrete
beams, and the "480" finite element is used throughout rather than the "410"

The buckling modes from STAGS are essentially the same as those corresponding
to the STAGS models in which the substiffeners are treated as shell units or as
discrete beams, except that the mode corresponding to PANDA2's margin 24 is
absent. Figure 5 shows the buckling mode corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue,
1.040385.


GENERAL BUCKLING MODE(S) FROM STAGS

Of particular interest is the determination of the general buckling load factor
according to STAGS. In this case one must include the entire cylindrical
shell in the STAGS model. Because of the presence of uniform in-plane
shear loading, Nxy, there are no planes of symmetry.

Table 600.23 of ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists the appropriate input data for the PANDA2 processor STAGSUNIT.
Note that in this model the substiffeners are smeared out and the major stiffeners
are treated as shell units. The STAGS "480" finite element is used throughout. The
outer surface of the panel skin is used as the reference surface and there are no
fasteners in this particular model.

In order to find the general buckling mode in this case it is necessary to
make several STAGS runs, each with a different initial "shift". This has to
be done because there are many "inter-ring" buckling modes that have eigenvalues
(buckling load factors) that bracket the lowest eigenvalue corresponding to the 
general buckling mode.

Table 600.24 lists abridged output from STAGS (testax4p.out2) for the three runs
required in this case to obtain the lowest general buckling mode (Mode 19).
There are results from two sets of three runs each listed in Table 600.24.
The first set of three runs corresponds to a model in which the outer surface
of the shell skin is used as a reference surface and there are no fasteners.
The second set of three runs corresponds to a model in which the middle surface
of the shell skin is used as a reference surface and there are fasteners. The
effect of this difference in modeling is minor: The buckling load factors from
the model with fasteners are from one to two per cent lower than those without
fasteners.


Table 600.24 Abridged output (testax4p.out2) from STAGS for the six STAGS runs
             required in this case to find the general buckling mode (Mode 19)
             and load factor. There are two sets of three runs each, the
             first set of three runs for a model with no fasteners and the
             second set of three runs for a model with fasteners.

====================================================================================


The general buckling load factor, 1.0511, for the "no fasteners" model,
corresponds to the 19th eigenvalue. This general buckling mode has three
circumferential waves. The general buckling load factor, 1.04201, for
the "fasteners" model, also corresponds to the 19th eigenvalue for that
model and also has three circumferential waves.

The buckling mode corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue, 1.022198E+00, is
shown in Fig. 6 and the buckling mode for the lowest eigenvalue corresponding
to general instability, 1.051100E+00, is shown in Fig. 7. Both of these modes
are for the STAGS model with no fasteners. The modes for the STAGS model with
fasteners, corresponding to the first eigenvalue, 1.008428, and to the 19th
eigenvalue, 1.042010,  are essentially the same.

All of the other eigenvalues correspond approximately to "inter-ring" buckling modes
similar to that in Fig. 6. In these relatively short wavelength buckling modes
the axes of the stringers deform and the rings primarily twist. However, for
most of the rings the axes of the rings also deform, as shown in Fig. 8. Figure 8
is produced by elimination of all the shell units except the two shell units
that correspond to the web and outstanding flange of the fourth ring from the
left end of the model shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 8 the
buckling modal deformations for the same mode (Mode No. 1) as that shown in
Fig. 6 are plotted to the same scale as is shown in Fig. 6. Because there is
significant bending in the plane of this and in the planes of the other rings, 
these "inter-ring" modes may also be considered to have significant components 
of general buckling: a short-wavelength general buckling mode similar in type to
that shown in Figs. 21, 26, 27, 29 of the paper, D. Bushnell, H. Jiang, N. Knight,Jr.,
"Additional buckling solutions in PANDA2", AIAA Paper 99-1233, pp 302-345, Proc.
40th AIAA SDM Meeting, April 1999.

Notice that in Table 600.24 the converged eigenvalues (buckling load factors) occur
in pairs. This is typical in STAGS models of complete (360-degree) cylindrical shells.
The buckling mode corresponding to each eigenvalue in a pair is the same except 
that one mode in the pair is rotated around the shell circumference relative to the
other.

The critical buckling mode is shown in Fig. 9 and the buckling mode corresponding
to the third eigenvalue, 1.371375, is shown in Figs. 10 and 11. The axisymmetric
buckling load factor, 1.371375, is not far above the critical buckling load factor,

A similar STAGS model was run with use of the "410" finite element rather than the

************* IMPORTANT NOTE ***************** IMPORTANT NOTE *********************
Although the critical general buckling mode according to STAGS
has long wavelengths (one halfwave in the axial direction and three full waves
over the entire circumference), a model in which all stiffeners are smeared
produces a prediction that is unacceptably unconservative (Table 600.28):

     1   1.288339E+00   1.288339E+00   0.000000E+00   12879 <--n=3 circ.waves

Compare the STAGS buckling load factor, 1.288339, from the smeared stiffener model
with the STAGS buckling load factor from the model in which the substiffeners are
smeared but the major stiffeners are modelled as shell units (Table 600.24):

     7   1.042010E+00   1.042010E+00   0.000000E+00   14217 <--19th mode(gen. buck.)

The model in which all stiffeners are smeared is unconservative by about 24 per cent.

With use of the "410" finite element rather than the "480" finite element in the
STAGS model, the unconservativeness of the smeared model:

   general buckling load factors = 1.340773E+00 vs 1.042010E+00,

is even more pronounced. The conclusion is that even though the general buckling
mode in Fig. 7 appears to be smooth, it is not good practice to smear the
major stiffeners. Models with smeared stiffeners may well lead to unacceptably
unconservative designs.

COMMENTS ON DIFFERENCES IN BUCKLING MODES FROM STAGS AND PANDA2

STAGS is a general-purpose finite element program. Therefore, the buckling modes
obtained from STAGS do not necessarily have to fall into a classification such
as "general" or "inter-ring" or "local" or "stiffener rolling without participation
of the panel skin", etc. For example, a buckling mode from STAGS may be a combination
of "general" and "inter-ring". The buckling load factors listed in Table 600.24,
other than that for Mode 19, correspond to buckling modes of this "mixed" type. Mode 19
is a pure general buckling mode in this case. 

What may be termed a "general buckling" mode from STAGS for descriptive purposes
is not always a "pure" general buckling mode, however. The paper,
D. Bushnell and C. Rankin, "Optimization of perfect and imperfect ring
and stringer stiffened cylindrical shells with PANDA2 and evaluation of the
optimum designs with STAGS", AIAA Paper 2002-1408, Proceedings of the 43rd AIAA
SDM Meeting, pp 1562-1613, April 2002, shows examples of "pure" and "not so pure"
general buckling modes. Figure 25 of that paper shows a "pure" general buckling
mode; Figure 24 shows a "somewhat impure" general buckling mode; and Figure 23
shows a "very impure" general buckling mode. The "impure" general buckling modes
have differing degrees of short-wavelength deformation superposed on what is basically
a general buckling mode. (Incidentally, Figures 20-22 of the paper just cited show
an "inter-ring" buckling mode similar in nature to those "inter-ring" modes in
the present case; there is considerable deformation of at least one ring in its
plane, as displayed in Fig. 22 of the paper, making this mode a combination of
"inter-ring" buckling and "general buckling".)

The classifications of "general", "inter-ring", "local", etc. ARE meaningful in the 
PANDA2 "universe", however. PANDA2 arrives at reasonable optimum designs with
reasobable computer execution times through the use of many different simplified
models for the prediction of buckling and stress. In applying PANDA2, one
expects that the appropriate combination of these simplified models will
lead to reliable preliminary optimum designs that are not too conservative and
for which all the "holes have been plugged", that is, there are not any critical
modes of failure that have been overlooked. Over the many years that PANDA2 has
been evolving, many such "holes" have been discovered and eliminated. (See the
file, ..panda2/doc/panda2.news).

Table 600.30 lists results from PANDA2 computations for the types of buckling
that are seen to occur in the STAGS models of the complete (360-degree) cylindrical
shell to which the results in Tables 600.23 and 600.24 correspond. Results from
five different buckling models are listed, three models of inter-ring buckling
and two models of general buckling.

As mentioned in previous PANDA2 literature, in PANDA2 knockdown factors are used often.
There are knockdown factors for weakening due to transverse shear deformation (t.s.d.),
to compensate for the inherent unconservativeness of smearing stiffeners, to
compensate for anisotropic effects and the application of in-plane shear loading,
to compensate for initial imperfections, and to compensate for possible truncation
error in the double trigonometric series expansions used in the alternative buckling
models. Several comments, "<--NOTE..." have been added to the standard PANDA2 output
listed in Table 600.30 in order to help give the reader a physical "feel" for what is
going on.

 MOST SIGNIFICANT HARMONIC OF THE BUCKLING PATTERN: (M,N) = (1,2) = 0.972

***************** NOTE ********************* NOTE ******************** NOTE *****************
 The dominant trigonometric term is (M,N) = (1,2), which means buckling with primarily one full
 circumferential wave over the circumferential width of the "patch", width=87.67 inches. This
 "patch" width is approximately 1/7th of the entire circumference of the cylindrical shell.
 Hence, the buckling mode predicted from this model is essentially the same as that predicted
 from Models 1 and 2. (Models 1 and 2 predict 6 rather than 7 full circumferential waves over
 the entire 360-degrees of circumference of the shell).

***************** NOTE ********************* NOTE ******************** NOTE ***************
 According to the PANDA-type (closed form) analysis, the critical (lowest) buckling load
 factor corresponds to (MWAVEX,NWAVEX) = (6,0) axial, circumferential halfwaves. PANDA2
 takes whatever eigenvalue is the lowest one and multiplies it by various knockdown
 factors (for t.s.d., for smeared stringers, for imperfections, for smeared rings, for
 anisotropy+applied in-plane shear loading) to arrive at a final buckling load factor
 to be used in the computation of the buckling margin. The knockdown factor for smearing
 rings, 0.77761, is computed from a formula based on general buckling with a minimum
 of two circumferential waves. Hence, the knockdown factor, 0.77761, may not be appropriate
 for the critical buckling mode, (MWAVEX,NWAVEX) = (6,0). However, that knockdown factor
 IS appropriate for the nonaxisymmetric buckling mode, (MWAVEX,NWAVEX) = (1,3), which is
 associated with a buckling load factor, 1.52. The (MWAVEX,NWAVEX)=(1,3) mode before
 application of any knockdown factors is close to that (1.48) associated with the
 critical buckling mode, (MWAVEX,NWAVEX) = (6,0).

 MOST SIGNIFICANT HARMONIC OF THE BUCKLING PATTERN: (M,N) = (3,1) = 0.989

********** IMPORTANT NOTE *********** IMPORTANT NOTE **************
 One term in the double trigonometric series expansion for normal buckling
 modal displacement is dominant: (M,N) = (3,1). There are three axial
 halfwaves (M=3) and one circumferential half wave (N=1) over the "patch"
 used for the alternative buckling analysis. Since the "patch" axial
 length is 112.5 inches (three major ring bays), M = 3 axial halfwaves
 means one half axial wave between adjacent major rings. The "patch"
 circumferential width is 43.84 inches (three major stringer bays). This
 width is equal to about 1/14th of the entire circumference of the shell
 (2*pi*r = 628.3 inches). Hence, N = 1 circumferential halfwave implies
 14 circumferential halfwaves or 7 full waves over the entire circumference
 of the shell. This is an inter-ring buckling mode and closely resembles
 that corresponding to Margin no. 4 in Table 600.13:

 In panda2.news Item 603 a modification to the alternative buckling model
 for general buckling is described in which the size of the "patch" is
 increased (doubled in the circumferential direction and multiplied by 5/3
 in the axial direction). Also, the upper limit on the double trigonometric
 series for buckling modal displacements is increased from 7 to 11. With
 this new, improved model of general buckling via the alternative theory,
 PANDA2 obtains in this particular model of general buckling;

STAGS MODEL FOR LOCAL BUCKLING

It is best to determine local buckling behavior from a rather small "patch". In
this case the STAGS "patch" includes only one bay between major rings (with a major
ring at each end of the "patch") and three bays between major stringers (with
a major stringer running along each straight edge (generator) of the "patch").
Hence, the "patch" is 37.5 inches long in the axial direction and 43.836 inches
long in the circumferential direction. The major stiffeners that run along the
four boundaries of the "patch" have half the stiffnesses of those that lie
within the "patch". As mentioned previously, all of the substiffeners lie within
the "patch". Figures 1, 12, 13, and 14 show the STAGS "patch" model suitable for a local
buckling survey.

The purpose of the STAGS model with use of a small "patch" is to compare predictions
with the various models that PANDA2 uses for the many types of buckling that can
be classified as "local" in this case. The buckling margins from Subcase 1 in
Table 600.13 that seem to apply best in this context are as follows:

27  1.16E-02 buckling:simp-support altsoln6  inter-subring  ; FS=0.999

Table 600.31 of ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists the input data for STAGSUNIT for the one-by-three-bay "patch".
The STAGS "480" finite element is used and all of the stiffeners, major and sub,
are modelled with the use of shell units. The middle surface of the panel skin
is the reference surface and STAGS "fasteners" are used to connect the roots of
all the stiffeners (major and sub) to the reference surface of the panel skin.

Many buckling modes were generated via five STAGS runs, each run made with use
of a slightly higher eigenvalue "shift" in the STAGS input file, testax4p.bin.
Table 600.32 lists the abridged testax4p.out2 files from each of the five STAGS
executions. Figure 1 shows the buckling mode and eigenvalue (buckling load factor)
corresponding to the critical (lowest) buckling load, 0.98903. Figures 12 - 14 show
selected higher buckling modes, modes that display especially well some of the
idealized buckling modes of the type computed by PANDA2 and listed in Table 600.13.


Table 600.32 Abridged and edited version of the output files, testax4p.out2 from the
             five executions of STAGS for the one-ring-bay by three-stringer-bay

PART 1 TYPES OF BUCKLING:

There are various types of buckling of the "patch". These types are identified by
the indices listed below in the left-hand column. Most of the STAGS buckling modes 
are combinations of more than one of the four "pure" (PANDA2-type) modes identified
as follows:

      eigenvalue from the larger and best 3 x 9 bay "patch" model is 
      9.778793E-01 (Table 600.16). It is expected that the larger and best
      3 x 9 bay "patch" model is a better model of the overall behavior of the
      complete shell than is the small 1 x 3 bay "patch" model.

Figures 1 and 12 - 14 show selected buckling modes from the STAGS "patch" model.
Figure 1 shows buckling of the panel skin and substiffeners together with some
deformation of the major stringers, a mode covered by PANDA2 margins 1 and 24
(PANDA2 Models 1 and 7). Figure 12 shows mainly buckling between subrings with
subring rolling and substringers participating in the buckling mode. This type
of buckling is covered by PANDA2 margins 26 and 27 (PANDA2 Models 9 and 10).
Figure 13 shows mainly rolling of the stringers, a mode covered by PANDA2 Margin
No. 17 listed near the bottom of Table 600.30 as

17 -2.58E-02 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=14;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6 

and near the top of Table 600.32 as BUCKLING TYPE 1: "sidesway of major stringers".

Figure 14 displays a combination of local buckling modes covered by PANDA2
margins 21 and 22 (PANDA2 Models 4 and 5):

BUCKLING OF SEGMENTS OF THE MAJOR STIFFENERS FROM PANDA2 THEORY

Table 600.34 lists output from PANDA2 corresponding to buckling of the segments of
the major stringers and major rings. These buckling modes are not seen in the STAGS
models for the range of eigenvalues explored here. One of them, buckling of stringer
Segment 4 (outstanding flange of the T-shaped major stringer),
is critical (PART 6 of Table 600.34):

 8 -3.99E-03 buckling margin stringer Iseg.4 . Local halfwaves=8  .MID.;FS=1.  

It's presence therefore probably affects the
evolution of the design and may cause the design to be a bit heavier than necessary.
To test this one would have to temporarily modify PANDA2 to eliminate this particular
buckling constraint and then re-optimize the shell. 

Another of these buckling constraints,

10  7.63E-02 buckling stringer Iseg 4 as beam on foundation. M=198;MID.;FS=3.

is almost critical. Notice that the factor of safety associated with this constraint
is 3.0. (See Items 383 and 572 of the file ...panda2/doc/panda2.news for more details.)


Table 600.34 PANDA2 models of buckling of major stiffener segments. These buckling
             models are not described in Tables 600.30 or 600.33. These buckling modes
             do not occur in any of the STAGS models as explored here.
=============================================================================================
PART 1 Theory...

 These constraints are derived from PANDA-type (closed form) theory.
 PANDA-type buckling theory is described in the journal paper:
 D. Bushnell, "Theoretical basis of the PANDA computer program"
 Computers & Structures, Vol. 27, No. 4, pp. 541-563, 1987

OPTIMUM DESIGN INCLUDING INITIAL BUCKLING MODAL IMPERFECTION

A general buckling modal imperfection with amplitude Wimpg2 equal to 1.0 inch
is assumed. The case is the same as before except it is called "testax4"
instead of "testax4p" (the "p" in testax4p is for "perfect").

The testax4.BEG and testax4.DEC files are the same as those for testax4p.
The new testax4.OPT file is listed in Table 600.35 of ITEM No. 600 of [ ]. Note that now there are
two load cases, the first with a positive general buckling modal imperfection (+1.0)
and the second with a negaive general buckling modal imperfection (-1.0).

The optimum design and margins obtained after application of SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
four times are listed in Table 600.36.

             modal imperfections with amplitudes, Wimpg2 = +1.0 and -1.0 inch.

The dimensions of the optimum design of the imperfect shell are preserved in the
file, testax4.chg1 (testax4.CHG), which contains the input data for the PANDA2
processor called CHANGE. The testax4.chg1 file is listed in Table 600.37 of ITEM No. 600 of [ ].

Next, in order to obtain a new (close) optimum design that is suitable for
analysis by STAGS, we must ensure that there are integral numbers of major
stiffeners over the entire shell and integral numbers of substiffeners
between adjacent major stiffeners. First we use the PANDA2 processor CHANGE
to reset the spacings of the major stiffeners and substiffeners to satisfy
this requirement. The new input file for CHANGE is listed in Table 600.38 of ITEM No. 600 of [ ].

Next, we execute the PANDA2 processor DECIDE with the input listed in
Table 600.12. The spacings of the major stiffeners and of the substiffeners
are no longer decision variables. To obtain a new optimum design suitable
for analysis by STAGS, we execute the sequence, SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT,
followed by execution of PANDAOPT for a fixed design (analysis type ITYPE=2
in the testax4.OPT file). The final optimum design suitable for analysis
by STAGS is listed in Table 600.39. As before, the optimum design is obtained
with initial buckling modal imperfections with amplitudes = +1.0 and -1.0 inch.

The new optimum design suitable for analysis by STAGS is preserved as input data
for the PANDA2 processor CHANGE. These input data are listed in Table 600.40 of ITEM No. 600 of [ ].

In the STAGS runs the imperfection is not present. If we wish to
compare the behavior of the newly optimized shell with the imperfection
neglected, we must execute PANDAOPT again for the same design, this time
with the imperfection amplitude set equal to zero. This was done and the
new margins are listed in Table 600.41.

PANDA2 generates two estimates of general buckling, one from a PANDA-type
(closed form) theory (Margin No. 16 in Load Set 1, Subcase 1 in Table 600.39
and Margin No. 14 in Load Set 1, Subcase 1 in Table 600.41) and the othr from
the alternative, double trigonometric series expansion, theory (Margin No. 17
in Load Set 1, Subcase 1 in Table 600.39 and Margin No. 15 in Load Set 1,
Subcase 1 in Table 600.41). These margins are given by
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Including the initial general buckling modal imperfection (Table 600.39, Wimp=1.0 inch):
16  8.71E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=2;slope=20.;FS=0.999 (PANDA-type)
17  6.27E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999    (alternative)

Neglecting the initial buckling modal imperfection (Table 600.41, Wimp=0.0):
14  1.46E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=2;slope=20.;FS=0.999 (PANDA-type)
15  5.03E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999    (alternative)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the initial general buckling modal imperfection has a much smaller
influence on the buckling margin derived from the PANDA-type (closed form) theory
than on the buckling margin derived from the alternative (double trig series expansion)
theory.

This difference in behavior is explained by Table 600.42. In the PANDA-type (closed
form) model the redistribution of stress from stiffeners to skin during prebuckling
bending of the imperfect shell has no influence on the predicted buckling load or mode 
because all stiffeners are smeared out in the PANDA-type model. Hence, this simplified
theory makes use only of the overall applied stress resultants which are the same
whether there is or is not an initial imperfection. In the alternative theory, in which
the major stiffeners are treated as discrete beams and only the substiffeners are
smeared out, the redistribution of stress from major stiffeners to skin-with-smeared-
substiffeners during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell does have an
influence on the predicted buckling load and mode shape. This influence is apparent
from the output from PANDA2 listed in Table 600.42.


Table 600.42 Buckling load factors and mode shapes from the imperfect and perfect
             shells as predicted by PANDA2 from the alternative (double trigonometric
             series expansion) buckling theory. The buckling domain in the alternative
             model is a three-major-stringer by three-major-ring "patch" and the
             substiffeners are smeared out.
=======================================================================================
NOTE: The quantities, NX, NY, NXY, are the prebuckling stress resultants (lb/in)
      in the panel skin-with-smeared-substiffeners. The quantities, XMAX and YMAX,
      are the axial and circumferential dimensions of the "patch". The quantities,
      EIGODD and EIGEVN, are buckling load factors from wavenumbers (M+N)=odd and (M+N)=even,
      respectively. The smallest of EIGODD and EIGEVN is the critical value.

PART 3 Difference in prebuckled state:

Note the difference in the prebuckling axial stress resultant, Nx, in the
panel skin-with-smeared-substiffeners:

with imperfection present (Wimp=1.0 inch):
 NX,NY,NXY= -6.639E+04 -1.835E+04  2.000E+04
            ----------

            ----------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART 4 Difference in buckling mode:

Also, note the difference in the buckling mode. With the imperfection present
there are several (M,N) pairs that are significant in the buckling mode:

   (M,N)     amplitude of buckling mode (from PART 1)
   (3,1)       +0.0971
   (2,2)       -0.233
   (4,2)       -0.222
   (1,3)       +0.105
   (5,3)       -0.437
   (7,3)       -0.540

With the imperfection absent only the (M,N) = (3,1) is significant, with
amplitude 0.973. This is essentially an inter-major-ring buckling mode with
major stringers participating in the buckling..

RESULTS FROM STAGS FOR THE CASE testax4


Table 600.43 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists the input data for the PANDA2 processor STAGSUNIT for
generation of a STAGS model which includes the entire shell. The major
stiffeners are treated as shell units, the substiffeners are smeared, and
the STAGS "480" finite element is used.

The buckling load factors from STAGS are listed in Table 600.44. In the first two
STAGS runs the outer surface of the shell skin was used as the reference surface and
there were no fasteners.
In the third run the middle surface of the shell skin was used as the reference
and there were fasteners connecting the roots of the major stiffeners to the
reference surface of the panel skin.

             major stiffeners are modelled as shell units, the substiffeners

The effect of change in model from "no fasteners" to "fasteners" is to reduce
the buckling load factor from 1.255294 to 1.241034, an insignificant amount.

Figure 15 shows the general buckling mode from the model with fasteners. In this
case the general buckling mode just happens to correspond to the lowest eigenvalue
(buckling load factor).

Table 600.45 lists results from STAGS for the same case, testax4, with zero amplitude
for the initial general buckling modal imperfection and with all stiffeners smeared.

Figures 15 shows the general instability buckling modes from the STAGS models with
only the substiffeners smeared, and Fig. 16 shows the same mode with all stiffeners
(major and sub) smeared. Note that smearing the major stiffeners raises the buckling load
factor from 1.2410 to 1.6193, more than 30 per cent. Even though the critical general
buckling mode is smooth (has long wavelengths) a model in which the major stiffeners
are smeared yields an unacceptably unconservative prediction for general buckling.

With use of the 410 finite element rather than the 480 finite element in the model
with all stiffeners (major and sub) smeared out, STAGS obtains eigenvalue=1.6953
for the first pair of modes, which correspond to n = 3 circumferential waves,
and 1.7260 for the second pair of modes, which correspond to n = 2 circumferential
waves. The buckling load factors corresponding to n = 3 and n = 2 are close to
eachother.

With neglect of the initial general buckling modal imperfection, PANDA2 obtains the
following general buckling margin (from Table 600.41):

14  1.46E-01 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=1;N=2;slope=20.;FS=0.999

(Remember: buckling load factor = (buckling margin + 1.0)*(factor of safety, FS).
           buckling load factor = (0.146 + 1.0)*(0.999) = 1.4485)

The PANDA2 prediction is about eight per cent conservative compared to the STAGS
prediction, and PANDA2 predicts buckling with two rather than three circumferential
waves. The PANDA2 buckling load factor for general buckling is computed as follows:

RESULTS FOR A SIMILAR STIFFENED SHELL WITHOUT SUBSTIFFENERS

The name of the case for the stiffened cylindrical shell with the
same overall dimensions (radius = 100 inches, length = 300 inches)
but without any substiffeners is "testax3". It is of interest to
optimize this shell and to compare the optimized weights of perfect
and imperfect shells without substiffeners with the optimized weights
of perfect and imperfect shells with substiffeners. (It was hoped
when I started this project in 2003 that the optimized perfect and
imperfect shells WITH substiffeners would weigh significantly less
than the optimized perfect and imperfect shells WITHOUT substiffeners).

Tables 600.50 - 600.52 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] list the input data for the PANDA2 processors,
BEGIN, DECIDE, and MAINSETUP/PANDAOPT for the case called "testax3",
the externally T-stiffened cylindrical shell without any substiffeners.

There are two inequality conditions in testax3.DEC not present in the preceeding
cases, testax4p and testax4, in which substiffeners are present. The first
of these two new inequality constraints requires that the width of the flange of
the T-ring be less than the ring spacing. The second new inequality constraint
requires that the spacing of the T-stringers be less than five times the
spacing of the T-rings. After several preliminary optimizations it became
clear that these two additional inequality conditions were required for the
following reasons:

1. to prevent impossible designs in which the rings become so closely spaced
or their outstanding flanges so wide that the outstanding flanges overlap.

2. to prevent "bombs" from SUPEROPT caused by a requirement that for an
IQUICK = 0 type of analysis the stringers must be closer together than
a distance equal to five times the ring spacing. This condition is
built into PANDA2; the user has no choice. When it is violated SUPEROPT
bombs because PANDA2 demands a change of model from IQUICK = 0 to
IQUICK = 1 and then exits from the mainprocessor.

The difficulties leading to the need for these two new inequality constraints
arise because, without any substiffeners present, optimum designs tend to
correspond to configurations in which the T-shaped stiffeners are close together.

Table 600.53 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists input data for the PANDA2 processor CHANGE. The values of
the variables correspond to the optimum design found for the perfect shell
without substiffeners after four executions of the sequence,
SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT.

Table 600.54 lists the optimum design, weight, and margins for the
perfect shell without substiffeners, testax3.

 ******************** DESIGN OBJECTIVE *******************

It is disappointing that the difference in optimized weights of
the perfect cylindrical shells with and without substiffeners
is insignificant. From the data just listed it can be seen that for
the optimized perfect cylindrical shell with substiffeners the weight
of the shell skin plus the weight of the substiffeners is close to
the weight of the shell skin in the optimized cylindrical shell
without substiffeners. The weights of the major stringers and the
weights of the major rings are approximately the same in the two
cases. It is not worthwhile including substiffeners just to save weight.

However, substiffeners may be considered if it is important that
the number of major stringers be minimized. The spacing of the major
stringers in the optimized cylindrical shell with substiffeners is
given in Table 600.6 by

   14.775 B(STR):major stringer spacing.

In contrast, the spacing of the stringers in the optimized cylindrical
shell without substiffeners is given in Table 600.54 by

   5.2141 B(STR):major stringer spacing.

There is a somewhat less dramatic effect on the spacing of the major rings:

 39.157 B(RNG):major ring spacing  perfect shell WITH substiffeners (Table 600.6)
 22.208 B(RNG):major ring spacing  perfect shell WITHOUT substiffeners (Tb.600.54).

Optimized designs of the perfect, externally T-stiffened cylindrical 
shells with and without substiffeners were determined for a range of
spacing of the major stringers. The results are shown in Fig. 20, generated
via a plotting routine "plotps" written by W. D. Bushnell.
From Fig. 20 one can see that the weight of the optimized
cylindrical shells without substiffeners is much more sensitive
to spacing of the major stringers than is the case for the
optimized cylindrical shells with substiffeners. This seems to
be the only advantage of adding substiffeners of rectangular cross
section to the panel skin. 

Other loadings, such as external hydrostatic compression (Nx = p*r/2;
Ny = p*r) and load combinations with more in-plane shear Nxy, were
investigated with the same conclusion: there is very little if any
advantage of adding substiffeners of rectangular cross section in order
to decrease minimum weight as long as the stringer spacing is permitted to vary
widely during optimization cycles. Also, the advantage of adding substiffeners
of rectangular cross section disappears if stresses become critical.
In this study we have set the allowable effective stress very high in order
that stress constraints will not affect the evolution of the design.

Different conclusions might be drawn if the substiffeners have other than
rectangular cross section. PANDA2 is not yet capable of handling
substiffeners with non-rectangular cross sections.  Also, it may be
that adding substiffeners to other parts of the structure than the panel
skin would be advantageous. Perhaps lighter-weight shells could be
made if substiffeners were added to webs and outstanding flanges of the
major stiffeners. There are no plans at this time to expand PANDA2's
capability to handle these new geometries.


GENERATE A MODEL OF THE PERFECT SHELL, testax3, WITHOUT SUBSTIFFENERS SUITABLE
FOR ANALYSIS BY STAGS

In order to evaluate the optimum design with use of STAGS there must be
an integral number of stringers over the circumference and an integral number
of rings over the length of the cylindrical shell. Table 600.56 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists input
data for the PANDA2 processor CHANGE whereby the stiffener spacings are
changed to the nearest values that correspond to integral numbers over the
entire shell.

New input data must be supplied to the PANDA2 processor DECIDE. The
stiffener spacings must be removed from the vector of decision variables.
The new input file, testax3.dec2 (testax3.DEC) is listed in Table 600.57 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ].


Table 600.58 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists input data for the PANDA2 processor CHANGE. The values of
the variables correspond to the optimum design found for the perfect shell
without substiffeners after three more executions of SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT.
During this "global" optimization the spacings of the stiffeners are held
constant at the values listed in Table 600.59 in order to obtain an
optimum design suitable for analysis by the STAGS computer program.

Table 600.59 lists output for the optimized perfect design suitable for
analysis by STAGS.

Table 600.60 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists the input data for the PANDA2 processor STAGSUNIT by
means of which two input files for STAGS, testax3,bin and testax3.inp,
are generated. In this case the STAGS model corresponds to a "patch"
that includes three ring bays and nine stringer bays. The middle surface
of the panel skin is the reference surface and there are fasteners that
connect the roots of the stiffener webs to this reference surface (tiny
black dots in Fig. 21).

Figure 21 shows the buckling mode corresponding to EIGENVALUE no. 1: 1.004224.

In order to see clearly that buckling in Mode Types 5 and 12 (two PANDA2 models of
inter-ring buckling) is prominant in the STAGS buckling modes, it is necessary to view
the STAGS buckling modes end-on without the rings present in the plots. This is done
via the STAGS processor STAPL with the following input used for STAPL:

threexninebays.testax3.allshells.480.perfect.endview
  1  0  1  0  $PL-2  NPLOT,IPREP,IPRS,KDEV
     1    21     4     0     1  $PL-3  KPLOT,NUNIT,ITEM,STEP,MODE
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9,    $PL-4 (units to be plotted)
 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
    0.0   3  $PL-5  DSCALE,NROTS
  1    0.0   $PL-6  IROT,ROT
  2   90.0   $PL-6  IROT,ROT
  3    0.0   $PL-6  IROT,ROT

In the list of input data for STAPL the buckling modal displacements for shell
units 1 - 21 are called for. Units 1 - 21 correspond to the cylindrical shell
skin plus the 10 stringers included in the nine-stringer-bay "patch". Each
stringer has two segments, the web and the outstanding flange. Therefore, there
are two shell units for each of the 10 stringers in the "patch". The eight
units corresponding to the four T-shaped rings are not to be included in the plot
because they would obscure the buckling mode.

Figure 22 shows the endview plot corresponding to the input data for STAPL just listed.
The endview plot of the STAGS buckling mode corresponding to the first eigenvalue,
EIGENVALUE=1.004224, shows clearly that there are five circumferential halfwaves
in the nine-stringer-bay "patch", which spans 47.12391 inches of shell circumference.
The 47.124-inch-wide "patch" represents 1/13.333th of the 360-degree shell circumference.
Hence, the same buckling pattern over the entire circumference would have 66.667
half waves or about 33 whole waves over 360 degrees. This mode is in very good
agreement with that predicted by PANDA2 for inter-ring buckling from the
PANDA-type (closed form) analyis (PANDA2 buckling mode type 5):

 5  1.57E-01 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=32  circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

Remember, the PANDA2 model spans 180 degrees of circumference. Therefore, the
number of circumferential HALFWAVES in the PANDA2 model is equivalent to the
number of FULL circumferential waves in a 360-degree STAGS model.

Table 600.62 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists input data for the PANDA2 processor called STAGSUNIT
required to generate a STAGS model of the optimized, perfect, complete cylindrical
shell. The T-shaped stringers and T-shaped rings are modelled as shell units,
and the STAGS "480" finite element is used. At the optimum design of the perfect
shell the T-shaped stringers are very closely spaced; there are 120 of them over
the entire (360-degree) circumference. There are 15 T-rings over the 300-inch
length of the cylindrical shell. Since each T-shaped stringer consists of
two shell units and each T-shaped ring consists of two shell units, there are
1 + (2 x 120) + (2 x 15) = 271 shell units in this very large STAGS model. This
STAGS model has about 580000 degrees of freedom.

The STAGS model predicts general buckling in a mode with three circumferential
waves at a load factor of 1.060638. This general buckling mode corresponds to
the 25th eigenvalue. Figure 23 shows the general buckling mode from STAGS.

All the other eigenvalues correspond to inter-ring buckling
in which the stringers bend. The lowest eigenvalue (buckling load factor) is 1.0512.
The corresponding buckling mode is displayed in Fig. 24. It was difficult to
find the one general buckling mode hidden like a needle in a haystack among a
thicket of short-wavelength buckling modes of the type shown in Fig. 24. (See
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS).

With the stringers and rings smeared out and with use of the 480 finite element,
the lowest eigenvalue corresponds to general buckling at a load factor of 1.170279,
an increase of about 10 per cent over that for the more accurate model: 1.060638.
The general buckling mode is the same as that found for the STAGS model in which
all stiffener parts were modelled as shell units. With use of the 410 finite
element in the smeared stiffener model the lowest eigenvalue increases from that
computed with use of the 480 element, eigenvalue=1.170279, to eigenvalue=1.194869.

Note that for this shell without substiffeners, in which the T-shaped stringers
and T-shaped rings are more closely spaced than is the case for the optimized shell
with substringers, the degree of unconservativeness caused by smearing the major
stiffeners is significantly less than for the optimized shell with substringers.
In those cases (testax4p for the perfect shell and testax4 for the imperfect
shell) smearing the major stiffeners raises the buckling load factor for
general instability from 1.0511 to 1.2883 for the optimized PERFECT shell with
substiffeners and from 1.2410 to 1.6193 for the optimized IMPERFECT shell
with substiffeners.

 ******************** DESIGN OBJECTIVE *******************

The inclusion of substiffeners leads to a weight saving of about 5 per cent.
This is a slightly better result than for the optimized perfect cylindrical
shells with and without substiffeners. In that case the weight saving is
an insignificant 0.8 per cent. (Optimized weights of 180 degrees of the
shell are 8356 lbs for the perfect cylindrical shell with substiffeners
vs 8423 lbs for the perfect cylindrical shell without substiffeners).

As with the optimized perfect shells with and without substiffeners, the
major stiffeners weigh about the same amount for the optimized imperfect
shells with and without substiffeners. The panel skin for the optimized
imperfect cylindrical shell without substiffeners weighs about 8.3 per cent
more than the skin plus substiffeners of the optimized cylindrical shell
with substiffeners.

The spacing of the major stringers in the optimized imperfect cylindrical
shell with substiffeners is given in Table 600.36 by

   17.782 B(STR):major stringer spacing.

In contrast, the spacing of the major stringers in the optimized imperfect
cylindrical shell without substiffeners is given in Table 600.64 by

   6.6650 B(STR):major stringer spacing.

Hence, as with the perfect shells, the presence of substiffeners of rectangular
cross section permits the major stringers to be spaced at much wider intervals
around the cylindrical shell.

There is a much less dramatic effect on the spacing of the major rings:

  48.508 B(RNG):major ring spacing, imperfect shell with substiffeners (Table 600.36)
  33.480 B(RNG):major ring spacing, imperfect shell without substiffeners (Tb.600.64).

Probably the spacing of the major rings would be influenced more by the presence of
substiffening for loading by hydrostatic compression, in which the hoop compression
is twice the axial compression, in contrast to the cases explored here, in which
the axial compression is five times the hoop compression.


GENERATION OF A MODEL, testax3, OF THE IMPERFECT SHELL WITHOUT SUBSITFFENERS
SUITABLE FOR ANALYSIS BY STAGS

As before, we wish to generate an optimized testax3 configuration suitable
for analysis by STAGS. Therefore, we must reset the stiffener spacings so
that there are an integral number of stringers over the circumference
and an integral number of rings over the length of the entire shell.
Also, we must omit the stiffener spacings from the vector of decision
variables. We use the input file listed in Table 600.66 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] for the PANDA2
processor, CHANGE, in order to reset the stiffener spacings:

The input file, testax3.dec2 (testax3.DEC), in which the stiffener
spacings are no longer decision variables, is listed in Table 600.57 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ].
The PANDA2 processor, DECIDE, is executed with that input file.

After one execution of the sequence, SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT, followed
by an execution of PANDAOPT with the design fixed (ITYPE=2 in Table 600.63 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ])
and with the print index, NPRINT=2 in that table, we obtain the
optimum design of the imperfect cylindrical shell without substiffeners
that is listed in Table 600.67.


Table 600.67 Optimum design and margins of the imperfect, externally T-stiffened
             cylindrical shell without substiffeners. This optimum design was
             found after one execution of the sequence, SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT,
             starting from the design listed in Table 600.64 with the changes
             listed in Table 600.66. This optimum design is suitable for analysis
             by STAGS.

=====================================================================================


Note that the optimum design suitable for analysis by STAGS is about 1.5 per
cent lighter than the optimum design obtained with the stiffener spacings free
to change during optimization cycles. (Weight = 10650 lbs in Table 600.67 and
Weight = 10810 lbs in Table 600.64. One naturally asks, "How can the optimum
design with the stiffener spacings held constant be lighter than that found
when the stiffener spacings were allowed to change during optimization cycles?"
or, one might ask, "Why didn't PANDA2 find the "better" (lighter) design when the
stiffener spacings were allowed to change?" There are two answers to this
apparent anomaly:

1. The "better" design listed in Table 600.67 is actually not better because one
or more of the margins is more negative than for the optimum listed in Table 600.64.
PANDA2 accepts designs for which no margins are less than -0.05. In this example
one of the margins listed in Table 600.67,

 7 -4.89E-02 Lo-n Ring sidesway, discrete model, n=7   circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

is very close to that limit of acceptability.

2. Often the "global" optimum design is very difficult for PANDA2 to find because
the behavior may change abruptly from design iteration to iteration. For example,
one or more critical buckling mode shapes may change abruptly during optimization
cycles.


RESULTS FROM STAGS FOR THE DESIGN LISTED AT THE TOP OF TABLE 600.67

The linear buckling analysis by STAGS for a three-ring-bay by nine-stringer-bay
"patch" of the  optimized shell, testax3, the design of which is listed near the top
of Table 600.67, yields a buckling load factor of 1.1428 (initial imperfection
not present in the STAGS model). With the amplitude of the general buckling
modal imperfection set equal to zero, PANDA2 obtains the following margins (among
other margins) for that design:

 5  3.23E-01 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=26  circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999
12  8.04E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999
16  1.44E-01 buck.(SAND);rolling only of stringers;M=14;N=0;slope=0.;FS=1.6

The circumferential width of the "patch" in the STAGS model is 60.15816 inches,
which corresponds to 1/10.4444th of the 360-degree circumference of the shell.
The lowest buckling load factor from STAGS, 1.1428, is associated with a
buckling mode that has five circumferential halfwaves over the 60.15816-inch
width of the "patch". This mode translates into 5 x 10.4444/2 = 26 full circumferential
waves over the entire 360-degree circumference of the shell. This mode is in
agreement with the buckling mode associated with the 5th margin in the PANDA2
model:

 5  3.23E-01 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=26  circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

which has 26 circumferential halfwaves over 180 degrees of the circumference of
the shell. The three buckling margins from PANDA1, Margins 5, 12, and 16, cover
the type of buckling observed in the STAGS model.


PANELS WITH SUBSTIFFENERS THAT FORM AN ISOGRID

The "substiffener" capability in PANDA2 was extended to include panels
with axial and circumferential major stiffeners and a skin that may be
reinforced by substiffeners of rectangular cross section that form an
isogrid pattern between adjacent major stringers and rings. 

Tables 600.68 - 600.70 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] list input data for the BEGIN, DECIDE, and 
MAINSETUP/PANDAOPT processors for a case called "testsubiso" in which
a cylindrical shell is externally stiffened by T-shaped stringers and
T-shaped rings and the skin of which is reinforced by external
isogrid substiffeners with rectangular cross section. In "testsubiso"
the substiffeners form a pattern of equilateral triangles with one
of the isogrid members oriented in the circumferential direction.


OPTIMIZED DESIGN FOR A PERFECT EXTERNALLY T-STIFFENED CYLINDRICAL SHELL
WITH SUBSTIFFENERS OF RECTANGULAR CROSS SECTION THAT FORM AN ISOGRID

Table 600.71 lists the optimum design found after five executions of the
sequence of PANDA2 processors SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT.

THEORY: CONTRIBUTION OF RECTANGULAR STIFFENERS TO THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
FOR LOCAL BUCKLING OF THE TRIANGULAR PIECE OF SKIN BETWEEN ISOGRID MEMBERS

One of the buckling margins for the case, testsubiso, is:

24  8.32E-02 Local subtriangular skin buckling load factor -1;FS=0.999

This margin occurs in the part of Table 600.72 for Load Case 1, Subcase 1.
It applies to buckling of the triangular piece of panel skin between
adjacent isogrid substiffeners. The margin is computed including rolling
of the substiffeners along the three edges of the small triangular domain.

Details of the buckling analysis of the triangular piece of panel skin
between adjacent isogrid stiffeners are presented in the paper,
D. Bushnell, "Global optimum design of externally pressurized
isogrid stiffened cylindrical shells with added T-rings", Int. J.
of Nonlinear Mechanics, Vol. 37, pp 801-831, (2002). In the
theory presented there it is assumed that the three edges of the
triangular piece of panel skin are simply supported. The effect of
isogrid stiffeners running along those edges is neglected.

Now the theory has been improved to include the effect of edge
stiffening provided the stiffeners have a rectangular cross section,
which is always the case with substiffeners. It is assumed that in
the local skin buckling mode the roots of the isogrid edge stiffeners
remain straight. The edge stiffeners simply rotate about their lines
of attachment to the panel skin. There is no deformation of the
stiffener cross section during buckling.

The local buckling of the panel skin between isogrid members is computed
in the TRIANG.NEW library. This library contains the subroutines in
which the stiffness A and load-geometric B matrices are set up and the
eigenvalue problem

                             Aq = Lambda*Bq                     (600.1)

in which q represents the vector of undetermined coefficients, a03...,
is solved. The Ritz method is used.  It is assumed that the triangular
skin is flat and that only the normal displacement component w and its
derivatives play a role.  The normal displacement w is expanded in a
power series in x and y in the triangular domain.  The domain and
coordinates are shown in Fig. 600.1.

The following expansion is used for the normal displacement w:

 w = a01*y

    +a21*x**2*y +a12*x*y**2    +a03*y**3                         (600.2)

At the boundary of the triangular domain shown in Fig. 600.1 the normal
displacement w must be zero.  The expression (600.2) for w satisfies
this boundary condition at y = 0.  The normal displacement w must also
be zero at y = (+ or -)(ax)+h, where "a" = 2h/S and h and S are shown in
Fig. 600.1.  The boundary conditions

                w = 0 at y = (+ or -)(ax) + h                    (600.3)

can be used to eliminate certain of the aij in Eq. (600.2). Tedious
algebra is required.  The final expression for w, which satisfies the
condition that w = 0 along all three edges of the isosceles triangle,
follows:

  w = a03*[h**2*y -2hy**2 +y**3 -4a**4*x**4*y**2/h**3 -4a**2*x**2*y**4/h**3

The local buckling load factor is computed from the principle of
minimum total potential energy. The potential energy consists of the
strain energy U of the panel skin and edge stiffeners and the work done
by the prebuckling resultants Nx, Ny, Nxy in the panel skin and in the
edge stiffeners during buckling modal normal displacement w.

The bending strain energy of the anisotropic panel skin is given by

   U(skin) = 0.5*Integral-over-y{Integral-over-x[C(4,4)*(w,xx)**2
            +2C(4,5)*(w,xx)*(w,yy) +C(5,5)*(w,yy)**2
            +4(w,xy)*(C(4,6)*(w,xx) +C(5,6)*(w,yy) +C(6,6)*(w,xy))]dx}dy

                                                                (600.5)

and the work done by the uniform prebuckling stress resultants Nx, Ny,
Nxy in the panel skin is

   W(skin) = 0.5*Integral-over-y{Integral-over-x[Nx*(w,x)**2
            +Ny*(w,y)**2 +2Nxy*(w,x)*(w,y)]dx}dy                (600.6)

The quantities (w,x), (w,y), (w,xx), (w,yy), (w,xy) are found by
differentiating the right-hand-side of Eq. (600.4).  Stiffness and
load-geometric matrices are computed at an arbitrary point in the
triangular domain. Integration is performed numerically, with the
trapezoidal rule being used for x-integration and Simpson's rule being
used for y-integration.

Now we wish to add the effect of edge stiffeners with a rectangular
cross section. The strain energy of an edge stiffener has the form:

   U(stif) = 0.5*Integral-over-s{Integral-over-z[C(4,4)*(w,ss)**2
            +2C(4,5)*(w,ss)*(w,zz) +C(5,5)*(w,zz)**2
            +4(w,sz)*(C(4,6)*(w,ss) +C(5,6)*(w,zz) +C(6,6)*(w,sz))]ds}dz

                                                                 (600.7)

and the work done by the uniform prebuckling stress resultants Ns, Nz,
Nsz in an edge stiffener is

   W(stif) = 0.5*Integral-over-s{Integral-over-z[Ns*(w,s)**2
            +Nz*(w,z)**2 +2Nsz*(w,s)*(w,z)]ds}dz                 (600.8)

In Eqs.(600.7,8) s is the coordinate measured along edge 1 or edge 2
or edge 3 (Fig. 600.1), and z is the coordinate measured normal to the
panel skin in the plane at the middle surface of an edge stiffener. That
is, integration over z is integration over the height of the rectangular
edge stiffener. The integrated constitutive coefficent, C(4,4), is the
axial bending stiffness of the edge stiffener and C(6,6) is the
twisting stiffness of the edge stiffener. Ns is the axial stress
resultant, Nz is the widthwise stress resultant (to be set to zero),
and Nsz is the in-plane shear resultant (to be set to zero).

Now we assume that the cross section of the edge stiffener does not
deform during local buckling of the triangular piece of skin; it simply
rotates about its line of attachment to the panel skin along the
coordinate s. This assumption leads to the following expression
for the normal buckling modal displacement distribution, w(s,z) over
the middle surface (reference surface) of the edge stiffener:

             w(s,z) = w,n(s)*z                                   (600.9)

in which w,n(s) is the rotation about the edge, which varies along s.

Because the cross section of the edge stiffener does not deform, w,zz
in Eq. (600.7) is zero. Also, it is assumed that the prebuckling
stress resultants in the edge stiffener, Nz and Nsz are zero. The
edge stiffener only has a prebuckling resultant along its axis
(parallel to the coordinate direction s). Furthermore, it is now
assumed that Ns is constant along s. At this point, it is also
assumed that the integrated stiffness coefficient, C(4,6), is zero.

With use of Eq.(600.9) and accounting for the simplifying assumptions
made in the previous paragraph, we obtain the following expressions
for the U(stif) and W(stif):

   U(stif) = 0.5*Integral-over-s{Integral-over-z[C(4,4)*(w,nss(s)*z)**2
                                              +4*C(6,6)*(w,ns(s))**2]ds}dz
                                                                (600.10)

   W(stif) = 0.5*Integral-over-s{Integral-over-z[Ns(z)*(w,ns(s)*z)**2]ds}dz
                                                                (600.11)

We now assume that the axial resultant in the edge stiffener, Ns(z),
varies linearly over the stiffener height, z:

    Ns(z) = z*(Ns(tip) - Ns(root))/H + Ns(root)                 (600.12)

in which H is the height of the edge stiffener, "tip" means "tip of
the edge stiffener" and "root" means "root of the edge stiffener".

We can now integrate over the z-coordinate to obtain

   U(stif) = 0.5*Integral-over-s[C(4,4)*(w,nss(s))**2*H**3/3
                              +4*C(6,6)*(w,ns(s))**2*H]ds       (600.13)

   W(stif) = 0.5*[Ns(root)*H**3/3 +(Ns(tip) - Ns(root))*H**3/4]*
                 Integral-over-s[(w,ns(s))**2)]ds               (600.14)

For an equilateral triangular piece of panel skin, the rotations w,n(s)
about the coordinate s along each of the three edges are given by

    w,n(s) =  cos(30)*w,x(s) - sin(30)*w,y(s)  for edge 1       (600.15)
    w,n(s) = -cos(30)*w,x(s) - sin(30)*w,y(s)  for edge 2       (600.16)
    w,n(s) =  w,y                              for edge 3       (600.17)

where edge 1, edge2, and edge 3 are indicated in Fig.600.1. The
derivatives, w,ns(s) and w,nss(s) that appear in Eqs.(600.13, 14) are
given by

    w,ns(s) = cos(60)*[ cos(30)*w,xx(s) - sin(30)*w,xy(s)] for edge 1  (600.18)
    w,ns(s) = cos(60)*[-cos(30)*w,xx(s) - sin(30)*w,xy(s)] for edge 2  (600.19)
    w,ns(s) = w,xy(s)                                      for edge 3  (600.20)
and
   w,nss(s) = cos**2(60)*[ cos(30)*w,xxx(s) - sin(30)*w,xxy(s)] for edge 1 (600.21)
   w,nss(s) = cos**2(60)*[-cos(30)*w,xxx(s) - sin(30)*w,xxy(s)] for edge 2 (600.22)
   w,nss(s) = w,xxy(s)                                          for edge 3 (600.23)

The quantities, w,xx(s), w,xy(s), w,xxx(s), and w,xxy(s) are derivatives
evaluated only along the three edges of the triangular piece of skin.
They can be obtained (with tedious algebra) from Eq.(600.4) evaluated at
the edges of the triangular domain.

Integration over s is carried out by Simpson's rule.

As seen from Eq. (600.4) there are 15 degrees of freedom, a03, a04,...
...a32, a41. The 15x15 eigenvalue problem is solved with use of EISPAC
routines.  The lowest positive eigenvalue is sought. If there is no
positive eigenvalue, the local buckling load factor is set equal to a
very high number so that no buckling constraint will be generated.

The new subroutines in the TRIANG library are called SIDE12, SIDE3, and STIFAB.
Information about these three subroutines is given at the beginning of each.
This information is listed in ITEM No. 600 of [ ].


EXAMPLE OF PROPER INPUT FOR A CASE IN WHICH SUBSTRINGERS AND SUBRINGS ARE ON
OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE PANEL SKIN

Table 600.73 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ] lists the input data for the PANDA2 processor BEGIN for a
case called "testax6". "testax6" is the same as "testax4p" except that
the subrings are internal rather than external. The substringers are still
external and both major rings and major stringers are external.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When the user chooses to have the major stringers INTERNAL during
the interactive session in BEGIN, PANDA2 views the panel skin-major-stringer combination
as shown in Fig. 8(c) on p. 490 of the long 1987 paper, D. Bushnell, PANDA2 - 
program for minimum weight design of stiffened, composite, locally buckled panels",
Computers & Structures, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 469-605 (1987). As with the external
major stringer, the internal major stringer is still viewed above the panel skin. 
In other words, the major stringer is ALWAYS on the NSURF = 0 side of the panel skin.
(NSURF is the index indicating which panel skin surface a substiffener set is attached
to: NSURF=0 means top surface (Layer No. 1); NSURF=1 means bottom surface (Layer no. n).

In PANDA2 terms, the curvature of the panel becomes negative when the user chooses
"internal" for the major stringers. In contrast, in the STAGS models generated via
STAGSUNIT, the sign of the curvature of the panel does NOT become negative for
internal major stringers. Instead, the major stringers are shown on the opposite side of
the panel skin from that shown for external major stringers. This difference in
convention may cause the user to think he/she has made an error or to think that
there is a bug in STAGSUNIT or PANDA2 when he/she chooses internal major stringers
and NSURF=1 for a set of substiffeners and then looks at a plot of a STAGS model.
In the STAGS plot the substiffener set for which NSURF = 1 will appear on the top
surface of the panel skin and the internal major stringers will appear on the
bottom surface of the panel skin. In other words, when the major stringers are
INTERNAL, STAGS views the panel upside-down relative to the way PANDA2 views the panel.

To summarize:
In PANDA2 jargon, NSURF = 1 for a substiffener set means "attach the substiffener set
to the bottom (NLAYER) surface of the panel skin. Because of the way PANDA2
models internal vs external major stringers, NSURF = 1 always means "attach the
substiffener set to the panel skin surface OPPOSITE to that to which the major
stringers are attached". Likewise, in PANDA2 jargon, NSURF = 0 always means "attach
the substiffener set to the SAME side of the panel skin as that to which the major
stringers are attached". This description about internal vs external major stringers
does not apply to major rings.

The spacings of the stiffeners were changed to values suitable for creation of STAGS
models: the new values correspond to integral numbers of major stiffeners over the
entire shell and integral numbers of substiffeners between major stiffeners. The PANDA2
processor CHANGE was used, and the appropriate input data for CHANGE are listed in
Table 600.75 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ].

The PANDA2 processor DECIDE was executed again with the stiffener spacings removed from
the list of decision variables. After execution of one sequence, SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT,
followed by an execution of PANDAOPT for a fixed design, the new optimum design and margins
listed in Table 600.76 were obtained.

Table 600.77 lists abridged output from STAGS for a "patch" model of the optimized
testax5 that contains three major ring bays (four major rings) and nine major
stringer bays (10 major stringers). The lowest eigenvalue, 0.956446, corresponds to
buckling with 4 circumferential halfwaves over the circumference of the "patch".
This "patch" circumference is 9 x 9.8175 = 88.3575 inches, which represents about 1/7th
of the circumference of the entire (360-deg.) shell. Therefore, the 4 halfwaves
over the circumference of the "patch" corresponds to 28 halfwaves over the entire
circumference, or 14 full circumferential waves. This mode obtained from STAGS
is therefore very like the mode from PANDA2,

 4  8.14E-02 Inter-ring buckling, discrete model, n=12  circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999

corresponding to Margin No. 4 from subcase 1 listed in Table 600.76.

             All stiffeners are shell units, the middle surface of the panel
             skin is the reference surface, and there are fasteners connecting
             the stiffener roots to the middle surface of the panel skin.

For a good "endview" of the 1st (or any) buckling mode listed in Table 600.77, one must
omit the major rings and plot the rest of the STAGS model. The appropriate testax5.pin file
for STAPL is listed in Table 600.78 in ITEM No. 600 of [ ].

Figure 26 is the plot corresponding to the input data for STAPL listed in Table 600.78
in ITEM No. 600 of [ ].


Table 600.79 presents results from STAGS for a general buckling model of the entire
shell. The internal substiffeners are smeared and the external T-stringers and external
T-rings are modelled as shell units. The middle surface of the panel skin is
the reference surface and the roots of the major stiffener webs are connected to
this reference surface by fasteners. It was a struggle to find the lowest buckling
load factor that corresponds to a long-wavelength general buckling mode shape.
Finally, the 13th STAGS run yielded that eigenmode: Mode Number 73. There are
several short-wavelength general buckling modes at lower load factors than that
corresponding to the critical long-wavelength mode. The short-wavelength general
buckling modes are of the type shown in Figs. 21, 26, 27, and 29 of the paper,
"Additional buckling solutions in PANDA2", Proc. 40th AIAA SDM Meeting, pp. 302-345,
April, 1999, that is, they are another type of general buckling mode. In Table 600.79
these modes are labelled "short wave gen."

The buckling modes labelled "inter-ring" in Table 600.79 are very short wavelength
inter-ring modes of the type displayed in Fig. 27, in which the first mode is displayed.
The first short wave general buckling mode, "short wave gen." (Mode 27), is shown in
Fig. 28. The first "long wave general buckling" mode (Mode 73) is shown in Fig. 29.

The relevant PANDA2 margins from Load Case 1, Subcase 1 in Table 600.76 are:

 4  8.14E-02 Inter-ring bucklng, discrete model, n=12  circ.halfwaves;FS=0.999
14  4.06E-03 buck.(SAND);simp-support inter-ring;  (1.00*altsol);FS=0.999
15 -4.73E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;M=6;N=0;slope=0.4637;FS=0.999
16  5.35E-02 buck.(SAND);simp-support general buck;(0.85*altsol);FS=0.999

Margins 4 and 14 correspond to the type of buckling shown in Fig. 27 but not
labelled in Table 600.79; Margin 15 corresponds to the type of buckling shown
in Fig. 29 ("long wave general buck." in Table 700.79 - Mode 73); Margin 16
corresponds to the type of buckling shown in Fig. 28 and labelled
"short-wave general buck." in Table 600.79.

General buckling is conservatively modelled by PANDA2 in this case:

lowest general buckling margin from PANDA2 = -0.0473;
lowest general buckling margin from STAGS  = 1.052581 - 1.0 = +0.052581.

a difference of about 10 per cent.

Please see the comments associated with Model No. 4 in Table 600.30
with regard to buckling in the mode "M=6;N=0;slope=0.4637" (Margin 15)
compared to general buckling in the mode "M=1;N=3:slope=x.xxxx"
as predicted by PANDA2's PANDA-type (closed form) solution.

Notice from Table 600.79 that the order of STAGS runs, 1, 2, ... 13, is not
always in order of increasing values for the "eigenvalue shift", called SHIFT
by STAGS. Sometimes it is necessary to go back and recover missing eigenvalues,
as was so here. (For example, STAGS run no. 2 has a lower SHIFT than STAGS
run no. 1).

Runs were also made with use of the outer surface of the panel skin as the
reference surface and with no fasteners. In such a model the eigenvalues were
higher. For example, in the model with the middle surface as reference surface
and with fasteners, the lowest eigenvalue for "long wave general buckling"
is eigenvalue = 1.13272, which corresponds to Mode No. 73. In the model with
the outer surface as reference surface and with no fasteners the lowest
eigenvalue for "long wave general buckling" is eigenvalue = 1.1392, which
corresponds to Mode No. 65 in that model.

Table 600.79 Abridged output from 13 STAGS run in a search for the lowest long-
             wavelength general buckling mode and load factor for testax5, the
             perfect cylindrical shell with external T-stringers and external
             T-rings and internal rectangular substringers and internal
             rectangular subrings. The middle surface of the panel skin is
             the reference surface and there are fasteners. The substiffeners
             are smeared. The entire shell is included in the STAGS model.

CONCLUSIONS

Adding substiffeners of rectangular cross section between major stiffeners does not
lead to significantly lower optimum weights. However, with substiffeners present the
optimum weights correspond to configurations in which the major stiffeners are
spaced farther apart than is the case for optimized cylindrical shells without
substiffeners.


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The author is most grateful for the help of Dr. Frank Weiler, a friend and colleague
at Lockheed Martin in Palo Alto, California.  Dr. Weiler frequently helped the author
whenever any problems arose in connection with executing STAGS on various computers
at the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center. Dr. Weiler ran and reran and reran
and reran the 580000-degree-of-freedom STAGS model generated by the file listed in
Table 600.62. Several reruns at different "eigenvalue shifts" were required in order
to capture the lowest general buckling mode, which was buried like a needle in a
haystack among a welter of local buckling modes. Each run required about 40 minutes on
the computer. (Dr. Weiler had to use a special computer with enhanced memory and disk
capacities. That computer, a Pentium 4 desktop with two gigabytes of memory, was
available to him only.)
