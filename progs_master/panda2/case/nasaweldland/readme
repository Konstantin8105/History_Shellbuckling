2009weldland.pdf is a file containing the report entitled:

"Use of PANDA2 and BIGBOSOR4 to obtain linear buckling
loads of an orthogrid stiffened cylindrical shell with
and without a weld land"

The purpose of this report is to determine the effect
of a weld land on the buckling load factor for a uniformly
axial compressed cylindrical shell with internal rectangular
rings and stringers. The configuration is taken from the
report:

Thornburgh, Robert P., "Axial weld land buckling in compression
loaded orthogrid cylinders"

The case is called "thorndesign1".

The work was done in late April, 2009. See Item No. 792 in
the file, ...panda2/doc/panda2.news.
