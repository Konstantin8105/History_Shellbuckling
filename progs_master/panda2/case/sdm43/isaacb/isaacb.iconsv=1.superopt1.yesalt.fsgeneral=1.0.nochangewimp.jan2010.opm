 The numbers of the references [ ] given in the CHAPTER
 headings correspond to those listed at the end of the paper:
 Bushnell, D.
 "Optimization of an axially compressed ring and stringer
 stiffened cylindrical shell with a general buckling modal
 imperfection", AIAA Paper 2007-2216, 48th AIAA SDM Meeting,
 Honolulu, Hawaii, April 2007

 The overall structure of PANDA2 and its use are described in
 the first PANDA2 paper, Ref.[1A], cited in the April 2007
 paper just identified. Ref.[1A] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "PANDA2 - Program for minimum weight design of stiffened,
 composite, locally buckled panels", COMPUTERS AND STRUCTURES,
 Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987

 Concepts such as "wide-column" buckling, "discretized module
 model", "stringer pop-off", "constitutive matrices"
 "reduction factor for transverse shear deformtion (t.s.d.)"
 "smeared stiffeners", "neutral surface", "overall and local
 static response to uniform pressure", "knockdown factors for
 anisotropy and in-plane shear loading", "crippling of
 stiffener parts", and "local postbuckling" are described
 there, with many early PANDA2 examples provided.

 The string, "PANDA-type theory" often occurs. This refers to
 the theory presented in Ref. [1B] of the April 2007 citation
 listed first. Ref.[1B] contains the theory given in the paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Theoretical basis of the PANDA computer program for
 preliminary design of stiffened panels under combined in-
 plane loads", COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES, v. 27, No. 4,
 pp 541-563 (1987).

 The theory used for local postbuckling behavior appears in
 Ref. [1C] of the April 2007 paper cited first (above).
 Ref. [1C] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
 under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
 regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
 Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114

 The theory used for imperfection sensitivity appears in
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] of the first-cited paper above.
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] are the following two papers:

 Bushnell, D. and Bushnell, W. D.,
 "Approximate method for the optimum design of ring and
 stringer stiffened cylindrical panels and shells with
 local, inter-ring, and general buckling modal imperfections"
 Computers and Structures, Vol. 59, No. 3, pp 489-527 (1996)

 "Recent enhancements to PANDA2" AIAA Paper 96-1337-CP,
 Proc. of the AIAA 37th Structures, Structural Dynamics and
 Materials Conference, pp 126-182, April, 1996.

 The last paper cited also describes the "global" optimizer,
 "SUPEROPT", implementation of Sanders shell equations into
 PANDA2, implementation of the Arbocz theory for imperfection
 sensitivity, implementation of isogrid geometry, and
 implementation of various truss-core geometries, with examples.

 The theories used in PANDA2 for the analysis of sandwich
 walls are given in Ref.[1F] of the first-cited paper above.
 Ref. [1K] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Optimum design via PANDA2 of composite sandwich panels with
 honeycomb or foam cores", AIAA Paper 97-1142, Proc. 38th AIAA
 Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference,
 pp 2163-2202, April, 1997

 The "alternate" (double-trigonometric series expansion
 buckling theory) and the discretized "skin"-ring module
 model are described in Ref. [1G] of the first-cited paper.
 Ref. [1G] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D., Jiang, H., and Knight, N.F.,
 "Additional buckling solutions in PANDA2", Proceedings of the
 40th AIAA SDM Conference, AIAA Paper 99-1233, pp 302-345
 April 1999

 Details of the strategy used in PANDA2 for accounting for
 initial buckling modal imperfections are described and listed
 in a table in Ref. [1K]. Ref. [1K] is the following paper:

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   9.5188E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     9.4830E-01
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   9.9769E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.11E-01
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.17E-01
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 Axial bending "boundary layer" length, BLL=  3.2622E+00, is
 less than the ring spacing,           B(2)=  4.0000E+00, so
 that it may be better locally to thicken the panel in the
 neighborhoods of the rings (or curved ends), rather than
 force the inter-ring properties to be uniform, as is done
 with PANDA2. Inspect carefully the stress and buckling
 constraints for both SUBCASE 1 (panel midlength or midbay)
 and SUBCASE 2 (at rings or at panel ends) to see if the
 constraints for SUBCASE 2 may be forcing the panel to be
 unnecessarily heavy in the midbay region. If they are, then
 read ITEM 175 in PANDA2.NEWS to see what to do to get a less
 conservative design.

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   9.5188E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     9.4827E-01
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   9.9768E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  1
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  3.17E-01
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.99E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  1.14E-01
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.11E-01
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.17E-01
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 The numbers of the references [ ] given in the CHAPTER
 headings correspond to those listed at the end of the paper:
 Bushnell, D.
 "Optimization of an axially compressed ring and stringer
 stiffened cylindrical shell with a general buckling modal
 imperfection", AIAA Paper 2007-2216, 48th AIAA SDM Meeting,
 Honolulu, Hawaii, April 2007

 The overall structure of PANDA2 and its use are described in
 the first PANDA2 paper, Ref.[1A], cited in the April 2007
 paper just identified. Ref.[1A] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "PANDA2 - Program for minimum weight design of stiffened,
 composite, locally buckled panels", COMPUTERS AND STRUCTURES,
 Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987

 Concepts such as "wide-column" buckling, "discretized module
 model", "stringer pop-off", "constitutive matrices"
 "reduction factor for transverse shear deformtion (t.s.d.)"
 "smeared stiffeners", "neutral surface", "overall and local
 static response to uniform pressure", "knockdown factors for
 anisotropy and in-plane shear loading", "crippling of
 stiffener parts", and "local postbuckling" are described
 there, with many early PANDA2 examples provided.

 The string, "PANDA-type theory" often occurs. This refers to
 the theory presented in Ref. [1B] of the April 2007 citation
 listed first. Ref.[1B] contains the theory given in the paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Theoretical basis of the PANDA computer program for
 preliminary design of stiffened panels under combined in-
 plane loads", COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES, v. 27, No. 4,
 pp 541-563 (1987).

 The theory used for local postbuckling behavior appears in
 Ref. [1C] of the April 2007 paper cited first (above).
 Ref. [1C] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
 under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
 regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
 Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114

 The theory used for imperfection sensitivity appears in
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] of the first-cited paper above.
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] are the following two papers:

 Bushnell, D. and Bushnell, W. D.,
 "Approximate method for the optimum design of ring and
 stringer stiffened cylindrical panels and shells with
 local, inter-ring, and general buckling modal imperfections"

 "Recent enhancements to PANDA2" AIAA Paper 96-1337-CP,
 Proc. of the AIAA 37th Structures, Structural Dynamics and
 Materials Conference, pp 126-182, April, 1996.

 The last paper cited also describes the "global" optimizer,
 "SUPEROPT", implementation of Sanders shell equations into
 PANDA2, implementation of the Arbocz theory for imperfection
 sensitivity, implementation of isogrid geometry, and
 implementation of various truss-core geometries, with examples.

 The theories used in PANDA2 for the analysis of sandwich
 walls are given in Ref.[1F] of the first-cited paper above.
 Ref. [1K] is the following paper:

 honeycomb or foam cores", AIAA Paper 97-1142, Proc. 38th AIAA
 Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference,
 pp 2163-2202, April, 1997

 The "alternate" (double-trigonometric series expansion
 buckling theory) and the discretized "skin"-ring module
 model are described in Ref. [1G] of the first-cited paper.
 Ref. [1G] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D., Jiang, H., and Knight, N.F.,
 "Additional buckling solutions in PANDA2", Proceedings of the
 40th AIAA SDM Conference, AIAA Paper 99-1233, pp 302-345
 April 1999

 Details of the strategy used in PANDA2 for accounting for
 initial buckling modal imperfections are described and listed
 in a table in Ref. [1K]. Ref. [1K] is the following paper:

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   9.5188E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     9.4830E-01
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   9.9769E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  5
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  2.03E-01
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.95E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  1.83E-01
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  3.88E-01
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  4.11E-01
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 Axial bending "boundary layer" length, BLL=  3.2622E+00, is
 less than the ring spacing,           B(2)=  4.0000E+00, so
 that it may be better locally to thicken the panel in the
 neighborhoods of the rings (or curved ends), rather than
 force the inter-ring properties to be uniform, as is done
 with PANDA2. Inspect carefully the stress and buckling
 constraints for both SUBCASE 1 (panel midlength or midbay)
 and SUBCASE 2 (at rings or at panel ends) to see if the
 constraints for SUBCASE 2 may be forcing the panel to be
 unnecessarily heavy in the midbay region. If they are, then
 read ITEM 175 in PANDA2.NEWS to see what to do to get a less
 conservative design.

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   9.5188E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     9.4827E-01
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   9.9768E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  5
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  2.03E-01
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.95E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  1.86E-01
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  3.90E-01
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  4.14E-01
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 The numbers of the references [ ] given in the CHAPTER
 headings correspond to those listed at the end of the paper:
 Bushnell, D.
 "Optimization of an axially compressed ring and stringer
 stiffened cylindrical shell with a general buckling modal
 imperfection", AIAA Paper 2007-2216, 48th AIAA SDM Meeting,
 Honolulu, Hawaii, April 2007

 The overall structure of PANDA2 and its use are described in
 the first PANDA2 paper, Ref.[1A], cited in the April 2007
 paper just identified. Ref.[1A] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "PANDA2 - Program for minimum weight design of stiffened,
 composite, locally buckled panels", COMPUTERS AND STRUCTURES,
 Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987

 Concepts such as "wide-column" buckling, "discretized module
 model", "stringer pop-off", "constitutive matrices"
 "reduction factor for transverse shear deformtion (t.s.d.)"
 "smeared stiffeners", "neutral surface", "overall and local
 static response to uniform pressure", "knockdown factors for
 anisotropy and in-plane shear loading", "crippling of
 stiffener parts", and "local postbuckling" are described
 there, with many early PANDA2 examples provided.

 The string, "PANDA-type theory" often occurs. This refers to
 the theory presented in Ref. [1B] of the April 2007 citation
 listed first. Ref.[1B] contains the theory given in the paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Theoretical basis of the PANDA computer program for
 preliminary design of stiffened panels under combined in-
 plane loads", COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES, v. 27, No. 4,
 pp 541-563 (1987).

 The theory used for local postbuckling behavior appears in
 Ref. [1C] of the April 2007 paper cited first (above).
 Ref. [1C] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
 under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
 regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
 Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114

 The theory used for imperfection sensitivity appears in
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] of the first-cited paper above.
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] are the following two papers:

 Bushnell, D. and Bushnell, W. D.,
 "Approximate method for the optimum design of ring and
 stringer stiffened cylindrical panels and shells with
 local, inter-ring, and general buckling modal imperfections"

 "Recent enhancements to PANDA2" AIAA Paper 96-1337-CP,
 Proc. of the AIAA 37th Structures, Structural Dynamics and
 Materials Conference, pp 126-182, April, 1996.

 The last paper cited also describes the "global" optimizer,
 "SUPEROPT", implementation of Sanders shell equations into
 PANDA2, implementation of the Arbocz theory for imperfection
 sensitivity, implementation of isogrid geometry, and
 implementation of various truss-core geometries, with examples.

 The theories used in PANDA2 for the analysis of sandwich
 walls are given in Ref.[1F] of the first-cited paper above.

 honeycomb or foam cores", AIAA Paper 97-1142, Proc. 38th AIAA
 Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference,
 pp 2163-2202, April, 1997

 The "alternate" (double-trigonometric series expansion
 buckling theory) and the discretized "skin"-ring module
 model are described in Ref. [1G] of the first-cited paper.
 Ref. [1G] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D., Jiang, H., and Knight, N.F.,
 "Additional buckling solutions in PANDA2", Proceedings of the
 40th AIAA SDM Conference, AIAA Paper 99-1233, pp 302-345

 THE GOVERNING KNOCKDOWN FACTOR FOR EACH TYPE OF BUCKLING
 (LOCAL, INTER-RING, GENERAL) IS SET EQUAL TO THE MINIMUM
 KNOCKDOWN FACTOR FOR THAT TYPE OF BUCKLING, REDUCED
 FURTHER BY THE RATIO (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) FOR THE PERFECT PANEL
 IF THE RATIO (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) IS LESS THAN UNITY:

 The ratio, (ARBOCZ/PANDA2), for local buckling of the
 perfect panel is being increased by the factor  1.5728E+00
 because the panel between stringers is fairly shallow
 and therefore the ARBOCZ theory is not strictly applicable
 to this portion of the structure. Overly conservative
 results may thereby be avoided.

 The ARBOCZ theory is used only if ICONSV=1. ICONSV= 1

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   2.0949E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     5.5340E-01
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   7.2819E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and

 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  2
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  5.55E-01
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.81E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  7.60E-01
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.30E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  2.39E+00
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 Axial bending "boundary layer" length, BLL=  3.2622E+00, is
 less than the ring spacing,           B(2)=  4.0000E+00, so
 that it may be better locally to thicken the panel in the
 neighborhoods of the rings (or curved ends), rather than
 force the inter-ring properties to be uniform, as is done
 with PANDA2. Inspect carefully the stress and buckling
 constraints for both SUBCASE 1 (panel midlength or midbay)
 and SUBCASE 2 (at rings or at panel ends) to see if the
 constraints for SUBCASE 2 may be forcing the panel to be
 unnecessarily heavy in the midbay region. If they are, then
 read ITEM 175 in PANDA2.NEWS to see what to do to get a less

 FROM PANDA2 THEORY:   9.3762E-01   9.8420E-01   9.7584E-01
 FROM ARBOCZ THEORY:   8.9506E-01   9.8783E-01   9.9217E-01
 THE GOVERNING KNOCKDOWN FACTOR FOR EACH TYPE OF BUCKLING
 (LOCAL, INTER-RING, GENERAL) IS SET EQUAL TO THE MINIMUM
 KNOCKDOWN FACTOR FOR THAT TYPE OF BUCKLING, REDUCED
 FURTHER BY THE RATIO (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) FOR THE PERFECT PANEL
 IF THE RATIO (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) IS LESS THAN UNITY:

 The ratio, (ARBOCZ/PANDA2), for local buckling of the
 perfect panel is being increased by the factor  1.5781E+00
 because the panel between stringers is fairly shallow
 and therefore the ARBOCZ theory is not strictly applicable
 to this portion of the structure. Overly conservative
 results may thereby be avoided.

 The ARBOCZ theory is used only if ICONSV=1. ICONSV= 1

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   2.0949E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     5.4961E-01
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   7.1755E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  2
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  5.57E-01
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.81E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  7.65E-01
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  1.30E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  2.41E+00
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 The numbers of the references [ ] given in the CHAPTER
 headings correspond to those listed at the end of the paper:
 Bushnell, D.
 "Optimization of an axially compressed ring and stringer
 stiffened cylindrical shell with a general buckling modal
 imperfection", AIAA Paper 2007-2216, 48th AIAA SDM Meeting,
 Honolulu, Hawaii, April 2007

 The overall structure of PANDA2 and its use are described in
 the first PANDA2 paper, Ref.[1A], cited in the April 2007
 paper just identified. Ref.[1A] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "PANDA2 - Program for minimum weight design of stiffened,
 composite, locally buckled panels", COMPUTERS AND STRUCTURES,
 Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987

 Concepts such as "wide-column" buckling, "discretized module
 model", "stringer pop-off", "constitutive matrices"
 "reduction factor for transverse shear deformtion (t.s.d.)"
 "smeared stiffeners", "neutral surface", "overall and local
 static response to uniform pressure", "knockdown factors for
 anisotropy and in-plane shear loading", "crippling of
 stiffener parts", and "local postbuckling" are described
 there, with many early PANDA2 examples provided.

 The string, "PANDA-type theory" often occurs. This refers to
 the theory presented in Ref. [1B] of the April 2007 citation
 listed first. Ref.[1B] contains the theory given in the paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Theoretical basis of the PANDA computer program for
 preliminary design of stiffened panels under combined in-
 plane loads", COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES, v. 27, No. 4,
 pp 541-563 (1987).

 The theory used for local postbuckling behavior appears in
 Ref. [1C] of the April 2007 paper cited first (above).
 Ref. [1C] is the following paper:
 Bushnell, D.,
 "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
 under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
 regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
 Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114

 The theory used for imperfection sensitivity appears in
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] of the first-cited paper above.
 Refs. [1E] and [1D] are the following two papers:

 "Recent enhancements to PANDA2" AIAA Paper 96-1337-CP,
 Proc. of the AIAA 37th Structures, Structural Dynamics and
 Materials Conference, pp 126-182, April, 1996.

 The last paper cited also describes the "global" optimizer,
 "SUPEROPT", implementation of Sanders shell equations into
 PANDA2, implementation of the Arbocz theory for imperfection
 sensitivity, implementation of isogrid geometry, and
 implementation of various truss-core geometries, with examples.

 The theories used in PANDA2 for the analysis of sandwich
 walls are given in Ref.[1F] of the first-cited paper above.

 honeycomb or foam cores", AIAA Paper 97-1142, Proc. 38th AIAA
 Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference,
 pp 2163-2202, April, 1997

 The "alternate" (double-trigonometric series expansion
 buckling theory) and the discretized "skin"-ring module
 model are described in Ref. [1G] of the first-cited paper.
 Ref. [1G] is the following paper:

 THE GOVERNING KNOCKDOWN FACTOR FOR EACH TYPE OF BUCKLING
 (LOCAL, INTER-RING, GENERAL) IS SET EQUAL TO THE MINIMUM
 KNOCKDOWN FACTOR FOR THAT TYPE OF BUCKLING, REDUCED
 FURTHER BY THE RATIO (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) FOR THE PERFECT PANEL
 IF THE RATIO (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) IS LESS THAN UNITY:

 The ratio, (ARBOCZ/PANDA2), for local buckling of the
 perfect panel is being increased by the factor  1.5728E+00
 because the panel between stringers is fairly shallow
 and therefore the ARBOCZ theory is not strictly applicable
 to this portion of the structure. Overly conservative
 results may thereby be avoided.

 The ARBOCZ theory is used only if ICONSV=1. ICONSV= 1

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   2.0949E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     5.5340E-01
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   7.2036E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  4
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  4.73E-01
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.04E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  8.46E-01
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  6.45E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.29E+01
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.

 Axial bending "boundary layer" length, BLL=  3.2622E+00, is
 less than the ring spacing,           B(2)=  4.0000E+00, so
 that it may be better locally to thicken the panel in the
 neighborhoods of the rings (or curved ends), rather than
 force the inter-ring properties to be uniform, as is done
 with PANDA2. Inspect carefully the stress and buckling
 constraints for both SUBCASE 1 (panel midlength or midbay)
 and SUBCASE 2 (at rings or at panel ends) to see if the
 constraints for SUBCASE 2 may be forcing the panel to be
 unnecessarily heavy in the midbay region. If they are, then
 read ITEM 175 in PANDA2.NEWS to see what to do to get a less
 conservative design.

 FROM ARBOCZ THEORY:   8.9506E-01   9.8783E-01   9.9217E-01
 THE GOVERNING KNOCKDOWN FACTOR FOR EACH TYPE OF BUCKLING
 (LOCAL, INTER-RING, GENERAL) IS SET EQUAL TO THE MINIMUM
 KNOCKDOWN FACTOR FOR THAT TYPE OF BUCKLING, REDUCED
 FURTHER BY THE RATIO (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) FOR THE PERFECT PANEL
 IF THE RATIO (ARBOCZ/PANDA2) IS LESS THAN UNITY:

 The ratio, (ARBOCZ/PANDA2), for local buckling of the
 perfect panel is being increased by the factor  1.5781E+00
 because the panel between stringers is fairly shallow
 and therefore the ARBOCZ theory is not strictly applicable
 to this portion of the structure. Overly conservative
 results may thereby be avoided.

 The ARBOCZ theory is used only if ICONSV=1. ICONSV= 1

 CHAPTER 11 Get change in stress resultants, Nx, Ny, Nxy in
            various segments of the skin-stringer module
            during prebuckling bending of the imperfect shell.
            Also, do PANDA-type [1B] local, inter-ring, gen-
            eral buckling analyses and PANDA-type stringer web
            and ring web buckling analyses to get knockdown
            factors to compensate for the lack of in-plane
            shear Nxy loading and anisotropy in discretized
            BOSOR4-type models. (See Section 11 in [1A])

 In-plane shear and anisotropy are not directly accounted for
 in any of the BOSOR4-type of discretized models. In order to
 compensate for this error, knockdown factors are established
 as given below for various types of buckling. These knockdowns
 account for:
  1. the effect of in-plane shear, and
  2. anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6), C(5,6)] in the panel skin.
 Knockdown factors from PANDA-type analysis are as follows:
    Knockdown factor for general instability=   2.0949E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for local instability=     5.4961E-01
    Knockdown factor (under hat crippling)=     1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for inter-ring buckling=   7.1755E-01                                     
    Knockdown factor for stringer web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
    Knockdown factor for   ring   web bucklng=  1.0000E+00
 Please note that the purpose of these knockdown factors is NOT
 to compensate for initial imperfections.  You can account for
 initial imperfections by assigning amplitudes of local, inter-
 ring, and general imperfections in the forms of the local,
 inter-ring and general buckling modes. And/or you can use
 appropriate factors of safety (different for different
 buckling modes) to compensate for initial imperfections.

 ******** ENTERING KOITER BRANCH, SUBROUTINE KOIT2 *********
 This subroutine is an implementation of the theory described
 in the PANDA2 paper by David Bushnell:
     "Optimization of composite, stiffened, imperfect panels
      under combined loads for service in the postbuckling
      regime", Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
      Engineering, Vol. 103 (1993) 43-114 (volume in honor of
      Besselings 65th birthday).

 LOCAL BIFURCATION BUCKLING LOAD FACTOR ESTIMATES
 AND AMPLITUDE Wo OF LOCAL IMPERFECTION, Wo*(buckling mode)
 Critical number of axial half-waves                =  4
 Slope of buckling nodal lines from Koiter Theory, m=  4.74E-01
 Knockdown factor for C44, C45, C55 for transv.shear=  9.03E-01
 Local buckling load Factor from Koiter-type Theory =  8.48E-01
 Load Factor from BOSOR4-type panel module model    =  6.50E+00
 BOSOR4-type load factor without knockdowns for
   effects of anisotropy [e.g. C(4,6)] of the skin,
   transverse shear def., or in-plane shear loading =  1.42E+01
 Amplitude Wo of local imperfection                 =  1.0000E-07

 Even if the load factor from Koiter-type theory is greater
 than unity, the panel is in a "post-locally-buckled" state
 because there is always a finite local imperfection in the
 panel skin and stringer that grows under the applied loads.
