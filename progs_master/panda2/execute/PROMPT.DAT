10.1  Are you correcting, adding to, or using an existing file?
10.2   
      In PANDA2, yes or no or help answers to prompts for your
      input must be in the form Y or N or H, respectively. (capital
      letter, one character only, please!)

      Usually, your answer will be N. However, if you are rerunning
      BEGIN or DECIDE or MAINSETUP or CHANGE or CHOOSEPLOT or CHOOSETEMP,
      and you have a good partial or complete file NAME.BEG or NAME.DEC
      or NAME.OPT or NAME.CHG or NAME.CPL or NAME.CPT, respectively,
      and you want to complete your interactive session or simply rerun
      BEGIN or DECIDE or MAINSETUP or CHANGE or CHOOSEPLOT or CHOOSETEMP,
      then answer Y.

      Note that you may only add entries after the last entry in the
      existing file. In order to change the file in other respects,
      you must edit it using the VAX edit mode.

20.1  Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?
20.2
      If you answer Y, you will see explanations after
      most prompts. The prompts and further explanations of them
      will be reproduced on your output file.

22.0  
      Your last PANDAOPT run must have used ITYPE = 2 (analysis of
      fixed design. CHOOSEPLOT will not work with ITYPE = 2. You
      must read the following and answer the question appropriately.

      If you have previously performed optimization iterations
      for this case and want plots of results from these iterations,
      then answer Y to the following question.

23.1  Do you want plots of results from design iterations (Y/N)?
23.2 
      An answer Y causes ITYPE to be changed to 1
      An answer N causes this run to abort.
     
24.1  Number of traces on this frame, NTRACE
24.2 
      Use a maximum of 10.

25.1  Abscissa value, ABSCIS
26.1  Any more abscissa values (Y/N) (Max. of 50 allowed)?
27.1  Ordinate value, ORDNAT
28.1  Any more ordinate values (Y/N) for trace no.
29.1  Any more traces on this plot frame?
32.1  Do you want to plot layers in skin-stringer module (Y/N)?
32.2 
      In the PANDA2 input you provide input for layer types. The
      same layer type may occur and recur anywhere in the skin-stringer
      module. It is a good idea to obtain a plot which shows where
      these layer types occur in the skin-stringer module, if for no
      other reason than to check your input. Each layer type is given
      its own symbol, and the distance between layers plotted is
      proportional to the thickness of the layers. The plotted curves
      correspond to the locations of the middle surfaces of each
      layer in each segment of the skin-stringer module.

34.0
      If there are many layers in any segment of the skin-stringer
      module, it will probably be advantageous to generate plots
      that show an expanded view of part or all of this segment. You
      will first be asked if you want any expanded views. It may be
      a good idea to answer N on your first try. Then you will get
      a plot of the entire panel module, showing all layers of non-
      zero thickness. Run DIPLOT and look at this plot. If any areas
      are too dense with lines and symbols, run CHOOSEPLOT again,
      this time answering Y (You WANT expanded views.)

      If you answer Y, you will next be asked to provide the x-
      coordinate of the center of the region to be expanded, a
      control integer (1=skin or 2 = outstanding flange) for the
      y-coordinate of the center of the region to be expanded, and
      the factor by which the region is to be expanded. CHOOSEPLOT
      makes the expanded region square so that the panel module segment
      widths will not be distorted. (Of course the thicknesses are
      scaled up, so that the thickness dimensions ARE greatly
      distorted so that you can see which layer type goes where.)

36.1  Do you want to show an expanded region (Y/N)?
36.2 
      If this is your first run to get the panel module "thickness"
      plots, answer N.  If you answer Y, you will next be asked for
      the (x,y) coordinates of the center of the region to be
      expanded and the factor by which the region is to be expanded.

38.1  x-coordinate of the region to be expanded, x
38.2 
      The x-coordinate of the centerline of the stringer is
      equal to half the stringer spacing:  x = b/2.

40.1  Control (1 or 2, type H(elp)) for y-coord of expansion
40.2
      1 means that the y-coordinate of the center of the region to
        be expanded lies in the plane of the panel skin ref. surface.

      2 means that the y-coordinate of the center of the region to
        be expanded lies in the plane of the outstanding flange.

42.1  Magnification factor for expanded view, FMAG
42.2 
      Depends on the case. Try 2 - 7.

44.0 
      You can generate a "3-D" plot of the local postbuckling pattern
      for a single panel module.  The undeformed and post-locally-buckled
      panel module cross sections are plotted for several axial stations
      covering one full axial wave of the local buckling pattern. The
      "3-D" effect is achieved simply by shifting the (x,y) origins of
      the cross sections by fixed intervals, (dx,dy). Only the results
      from the last load step are plotted in this way.

46.1  Do you want a "3-D" plot of the buckled panel module (Y/N)?
46.2  
      If you answer Y the vectors to be plotted by DIPLOT are stored
      in the file NAME.PL7.

48.1  Do you want a plot of the objective v. iterations (Y/N)?
48.2  
      You should obtain this if you have not already!

50.1  Do you want to get more plots before your next "SUPEROPT"?
50.2  
      Make sure to get all the plots you want before executing
      SUPEROPT again.  If you answer N , the total number of design
      iterations will get reset to zero, and the design history will
      be lost. If your answer Y, the total number of design iterations
      will not be reset to zero. (However, in that case a subsequent
      execution of SUPEROPT will not yield any useful information).

      Just make sure you do all the CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT executions you
      need to before you answer N .  If this is the last set of plots
      you need from the previous execution of SUPEROPT, then answer N .

51.1  Is this a STAGS postprocessing (always answer N)?
51.2 
      This question is now out of date. Please always answer N

52.1  Choose type of STAGS analysis (1,3,4,5,6),INDIC
52.2  
      INDIC = 1 means linear bifurcation buckling analysis. The
                purposes are: 
                (a) to compare with PANDA2 predictions for local
                    and/or general buckling load factors and mode shapes;
                (b) to obtain one or more buckling mode shapes to be
                    used later with an INDIC = 3 nonlinear analysis
                    of an imperfect shell.
                    The imperfections are in the shapes of user-selected 
                    buckling modes predicted with the INDIC=1 analysis.

      INDIC = 3 means nonlinear static analysis over a user-provided
                range of loads, analogous to the ITYPE=3 analysis
                (test simulation) with PANDA2.

      The user should first run STAGSMODEL or STAGSUNIT with INDIC = 1,
      followed by subsequent runs of STAGSMODEL or STAGSUNIT with INDIC = 3.
      If STAGS cannot continue to obtain solutions for load factors that
      approach the general instability or wide-column buckling load predicted
      by PANDA, then it will be necessary to use a more complex strategy
      involving the other analysis types, INDIC = 4, 5, and 6:

      INDIC = 4 means bifurcation buckling with nonlinear prebuckling.
              To be used if the user wants a new imperfection shape.

      INDIC = 5 means small vibrations with nonlinear prebuckling.
              To be used in order to get appropriate time step for
              nonlinear transient analyses.

      INDIC = 6 means nonlinear transient response analysis. (see
              PANDA2.NEWS ITEM 259 and AIAA Paper No. 97-1141).

53.1  Restart from ISTARTth load step (0=1st nonlinear soln), ISTART
53.2 
      If this is NOT a STAGS POSTPROCESSOR run:
        ISTART = 0 Always use ISTART = 0 if INDIC = 1
        ISTART = 0 means you are starting the nonlinear analysis and
                   have no previous load steps to start from.
        ISTART > 0 means you are using the solution at load step
                   number ISTART as a starting solution for the next
                   STAGS run.  If ISTART > 0 make sure that the starting
                   load factors STLD(1) and STLD(2) on the C-1 record
                   correspond to load step ISTART.

      If this IS a STAGS POSTPROCESSOR run:
        ISTART = n is the load step number for which you want to
                   generate data via the STAGS postprocessor POSTP.
                   n = 0 means you will get the linear response.

54.1  Local buckling load factor from PANDA2, EIGLOC
54.2  
      Use EIGLOC = 0 unless INDIC = 1  (bifurcation buckling).

      You can find EIGLOC in the NAME.OPM file. Look for the margin
      or margins corresponding to local buckling. The load factor
      for local buckling is given by:

                 EIGLOC = FSLOC*(MARGIN + 1.)

      in which FSLOC is the factor of safety for local buckling.

55.1  Are the dimensions in this case in inches?
55.2  
      An answer is needed to this question so that STAGS will know
      what value to use for the acceleration of gravity.

56.1  Acceleration of gravity, GRAV
56.2  
      Be sure to provide the correct value of GRAV in the units used
      in this case!

57.1  Lowest vibration frequency (cps) from STAGS INDIC=5 run, CPS
57.2  
      Use CPS = 0 unless INDIC = 6 (nonlinear transient run).

      NOTE: units are cycles/sec (hertz). To obtain the value look
      for the lowest eigenvalue in the *.OUT2 file from the latest
      INDIC = 5 run with STAGS (vibration with nonlinear prestress).

58.1  Percent damping to be used in STAGS transient (INDIC=6) run.
58.2   
      Use 0 unless INDIC = 6.

      Use 0.1 - 0.3 if INDIC = 6. If you use 0, PANDA2 will supply 0.15.

59.1  Choose: 0=original solver  OR  -1=fancy new (VSL) solver?
59.2
      For small problems (less than about 10000 d.o.f) choose 0
      If you plan to force the panel edges to remain straight, choose 0
      (PANDA2 will automatically set ISOLVR = 0 if you later elect to
      force the panel edges to remain straight). The new solver does
      not yet work if there are Lagrange mulipliers in the problem.

60.1  Are the material properties temperature-dependent?
60.2 
      Even if the material properties are temperature-dependent,
      if your case involves only a single uniform temperature, or
      if the material properties are reasonably constant over the
      range of temperatures experienced by your panel, you should
      save yourself trouble by answering N.

      If you answer Y, you will be asked later to select properties
      that depend on the temperature. For each of the selected properties
      you will have to provide a table of "knockdown" (or "knockup")
      factors for that property for at least two temperatures that span
      the temperatures experienced by the material during service.

      The material properties that you provide next are nominal
      values, Pn, that will be multiplied later by PANDA2 by appropriate
      factors that account for temperature.  A typical property used in
      the computations will be:  P(i,T) = Pn(i)*Fi(T), in which i means
      "ith property", T = Temperature, and Fi is a function of
      temperature, pertaining to the ith property, that you will
      provide later in a tabular (discrete values) form, Fi(Tj), j = 1,
      2, 3,... Linear interpolation is later used by PANDA2 to obtain
      Fi(T) from the discrete tabular values, Fi(Tj).

62.1  Do any of the properties listed above vary with temperature?

64.1  Choose a material property that varies with temperature (1,2,3,..)
64.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the table above.

65.1  Any more properties that are temperature dependent?
66.1  Choose a temperature for this property, T
68.1  Material property factor corresponding to T(j): F
70.1  Any more [ Tj, F(Tj) ] pairs for this material property?
72.1  Is there any thermal "loading" in this load set (Y/N)?
72.2 
      What is meant is thermal loading other than curing.
      Usually, you answer N.  If there is aerodynamic heating or
      other source of heating which may be significant in your case,
      answer Y. If you answer Y, you will be asked to provide two
      temperatures for the panel skin (corresponding to the uppermost
      and lowermost surfaces of the panel skin and stringer/ring bases)
      and one temperature each for the outstanding stringer flange
      and outstanding ring flange. (With blade stiffening, you will
      be asked to provide the temperature at the blade tip). The
      temperatures you will provide are assumed to be uniform over
      each segment of the panel module except as follows:

       1. the panel skin and stringer and ring bases, in which the
          temperature is assumed to vary linearly through the thickness,
          except in the case of truss-core for which the temperature
          in the panel skin is constant through the thicknesses of each
          of the two face sheets (different in the two sheets, though).

       2. the stiffener webs, in which the temperature is assumed to
          vary linearly from the web root to the web tip. At the web
          root the web temperature is the same as that of the panel skin
          at that point. At the web tip the web temperature is assumed
          to be the same as that of the outstanding flange.

73.0  Now provide temperatures for each segment of the skin-stringer
      and/or skin-ring panel modules. The temperatures you provide for
      a given segment are assumed by PANDA2 to be uniform in that segment,
      except as follows:
      Temperature varies linearly through the thickness of the panel skin.
      Temperature varies linearly from stiffener web root to web tip.

      If the materials in your case are temperature-dependent, make sure
      that you give the command CHOOSETEMP before you execute PANDAOPT.
      Make sure that the ranges of temperature that you provide for the
      input tables of material properties v. temperature are wide enough
      to cover the range of temperatures that you will provide here.

74.1  Temperature rise, panel skin, surface opposite stiffener, TEMP
74.2 
      The surface opposite the stringer is the lowest surface (See
      Fig. 8a, p 490 in the long 1987 Computers and Structures paper).
      If there are no stringers, it is still the lowest surface (Fig8a,d).
      If the panel is cylindrical and there are no stringers or there are
      external stringers, this is the inner surface of the cylindrical
      wall (see Figs. 8b,d). If the panel is cylindrical and there are
      internal stringers, this is the outer surface of the cylindrical
      wall (see Fig. 8c).

      What is wanted is the delta-temperature above (+) or below (-)
      ambient ("room" temperature). The temperature is assumed to be
      uniform across the width of the panel skin and stringer base.
      Except for truss-core sandwich, the temperature is assumed to
      vary linearly through the thickness of the panel skin and
      stringer/ring bases, with the value of the temperature at the upper
      surface of the panel skin in Fig. 8a to be provided later by you.

      In the truss-core sandwich, the temperature is uniform thru the
      thickness of each of the panel module segments.

75.1  Temperature rise, panel skin, at stiffener root, TEMP
75.2  
      This is the temperature rise in the panel skin and stringer base
      on the same surface where the stringer web intersects the stringer
      base, that is, the surface opposite to that for which you just
      provided the temperature rise.

76.1  Temperature rise TEMP (not used anymore)
77.1  Temperature rise in Segment 4 (stiffener flange), TEMP
78.1  Temperature rise in Seg. 3 (blade) at tip of blade, TEMP
80.1  Temperature rise in Segment 1 (lower skin), TEMP
80.2 
      What is wanted is the delta-Temperature above (+) or below (-)
      ambient ("room" temperature). Temperature assumed uniform thru
      thickness and across width of panel skin. THIS OPTION IS FOR
      THE TRUSS-CORE WALL CONSTRUCTION ONLY. 

      The lower face sheet (skin) is Segment 1.
      The truss-core webs are Segments 2 and 4.
      The upper face sheet (skin) is Segment 3.

81.1  Temperature rise in Segment 2 (truss web), TEMP  (not used anymore)
82.1  Temperature rise in Segment 3 (upper skin), TEMP
85.1  Is the thermal loading part of Load Set B (Type H for Help)?
85.2 
      If the thermal loading represents a very significant part
      of the total loading, then answer N (put the thermal loads
      in Load Set A).

      Otherwise, answer Y (put the thermal loading in Load Set B).

      Look carefully at your results.  If you suspect that the
      thermal loading may cause local buckling by itself, then
      run again, this time answering N (thereby putting the 
      thermal loading in Load Set A). 

86.1  Want to include dependence of matl props on temperature?
86.2  
      It's probably a good idea to answer N at first. When you
      get near an optimum design, then you might answer Y. More
      computer time will be required if you answer Y.

87.1  Number of nodes over width of stringer flange, NDFLGS
87.2
      Ordinarily use a small number such as 5. If you use
      less than 5, PANDA2 will automatically change it to 5.
      If you use more than 13 PANDA2 will automatically
      change it to 13.

      You must use an odd number and (NDFLGS-1) must be
      divisible by 4.

      In other words, NDFLGS must be either 5 or 9 or 13

88.1  Number of nodes over width of ring flange, NDFLGR
88.2  
      Ordinarily use a small number such as 5. If you use
      less than 5, PANDA2 will automatically change it to 5.
      If you use more than 13 PANDA2 will automatically
      change it to 13.

      You must use an odd number and (NDFLGR-1) must be
      divisible by 4.

      In other words, NDFLGR must be either 5 or 9 or 13

89.1  Number of finite elements over circumference, NELCIR
89.2  
      NOTE: THE SUB-STRINGERS MUST BE SMEARED OUT!
                STRINGERS CAN BE SHELL UNITS.

90.1  Nonlinear (0) or linear (1) kinematic relations?, ILIN
90.2 
      Ordinarily, you should set ILIN = 0

      However, occasionally general buckling mode shapes are
      "dirty". That is, smooth relatively long-wavelength general
      buckling modes are "polluted" by very short-wavelength
      "noise". Example: see Fig. 39, p 1612 of "Optimization of perfect
      and imperfect ring and stringer stiffened cylindrical shells
      with PANDA2 and evaluation of the optimum designs with STAGS",
      AIAA Paper 2002-1408, Proceedings of the AIAA 43rd SDM
      Conference, Denver, CO, 2002, pp 1562-1613.

      With ILIN = 1 much, perhaps all, of the short-wavelength
      "noise" will be filtered out. Try ILIN = 0 first. If you get
      "polluted" general buckling mode shapes which are usually
      unsuitable to use as initial imperfection shapes, use
      ILIN = 1 for the linear bifurcation buckling analysis.

      NOTE: For the nonlinear (INDIC=3) STAGS runs, always use
      ILIN = 0

91.1  Type 1 for closed (360-deg) cyl. shell, 0 otherwise, ITOTAL 
91.2 
      If you are modeling a cylindrical shell that spans 360
      degrees, answer ITOTAL = 1

      If you are modeling a flat or cylindrical panel that spans
      less than 360 degrees then answer ITOTAL = 0 except in the
      following circumstance:

      If you are setting up a compound cylindrical model and the
      compound model spans 360 degrees, answer ITOTAL = 1.

      See Fig. 56 in the paper, "Difficulties in optimization of
      imperfect stiffened cylindrical shells", AIAA Paper 2006-1943,
      47th AIAA SDM Meeting, Newport, RI May 1-4, 2006, for an
      example of a "compound" model. If the compound model is a
      complete (360-degree) cylindrical shell it is closed (ITOTAL=1).
      The logic will proceed as if the shell is closed even though
      you set YSTAGS to a value considerably less than that which
      corresponds to 360 degrees. 

92.1  Starting angle for STAGS model, ANGBEG
92.2  
      ANGBEG = circumferential angle in degrees to the first nodal
      point in the cylindrical shell skin in this particular part
      of the compound STAGS model. For example, in the
      compound model shown in Fig. 56 of the paper "Difficulties in
      optimization of imperfect stiffened cylindrical shells", AIAA
      Paper 2006-1943. 47th AIAA SDM Meeting, Newport, RI May 1-4,
      2006, there are two major parts of the compound STAGS model:
      a 60-degree sector in which both the stringers and rings are
      modeled as shell units and a 300-degree sector in which the
      stringers are smeared out and only the rings are modeled as
      shell units.

      ANGBEG for the 60-degree sector with the stringers as
      shell branches would be zero. ANGBEG for the remaining 300
      degrees of the cylindrical shell, that is, the sector in
      which the stringers are smeared out, would be 60 degrees.
      ANGBEG = 60 degrees corresponds to the end circumferential
      coordinate of the 60-degree sector part of the compound
      STAGS model.

93.1  How many shell units in previous sections? IUNITX
93.2  
      This question applies to compound STAGS models of the type
      shown in Fig. 56 of the paper "Difficulties in optimization
      of imperfect stiffened cylindrical shells", AIAA Paper
      2006-1943. 47th AIAA SDM Meeting, Newport, RI May 1-4, 2006.
      The compound model is built up by adding sections from
      previous STAGSUNIT runs, with some modifications. Each of
      these sections has a number of shell units.
     
      What is wanted here is the total number of shell units
      in previously processed sections of the compound model.

      Most often there will be only one previous section, for
      example, the 60-degree sector in which both stringers
      and rings are modeled as shell units. (See Fig. 56).
      In this example, the 60-degree sector has 63 shell units.
      Hence, in this example, the user would set IUNITX = 63 if
      he/she were now dealing with the 300-degree remainder of
      the cylindrical shell, the part in Fig. 56 in which the
      stringers are smeared out and only the skin-with-smeared-
      stringers and the rings are modeled as shell units.

      If you are now dealing with the first section of the
      compound STAGS model, set IUNITX = 0

94.0 
      Now you start to provide input data. You will be prompted by
      short questions. If you need help, just type H as an
      answer to the prompt instead of the datum called for. In most
      instances you will then be given more information on the datum
      you must provide. It may be a good idea to run the tutorial
      option if you are a new user of PANDA2.

      Overall panel dimensions:
        1. length normal to the plane of the screen, L1
        2. length in the plane of the screen,        L2

      SOME ADVICE ON MODELING WHEN NORMAL PRESSURE IS PRESENT:
      If you are designing a panel that has both stringers and rather
      large rings, and you expect that in the prebuckling phase there
      may be significant bending between these large rings due to the
      pressure, then set up models in which there are stringers only,
      or stringers and weak rings. ("weak" implies that the normal
      pressure does not cause significant local axial bending between
      them.) The entire axial length of each model must be equal to the
      spacing of the large rings. The boundary conditions along the
      edges where the large rings are supposed to be should be clamped
      for the prebuckling phase and simply supported for the buckling
      phase of the analysis if the stringers are not tapered in the
      neighborhoods of the large rings.  If the stringers are tapered
      near the large rings, then use simple support for both the
      prebuckling and the buckling phases of the analysis.

95.1  Panel length normal to the plane of the screen, L1
95.2 
      This is the axial length of the panel. For a cylindrical panel,
      this is the length of the generator of the panel. This is the
      x - direction.

96.1  X-direction length of the STAGS model of the panel: XSTAGS
96.2 
      This is the axial length of the part of the panel to be included
      in the STAGS model. (The X-direction is along the stringer axis).
      
      If PANDA2 indicates that there are many axial waves in the local
      buckling pattern, then it may be best to use STAGS to explore only
      the local bifurcation and post-bifurcation behavior, rather than
      the general instability behavior. In such a case you might choose
      a length XSTAGS that is equal to no more than about 10 axial
      half-waves of the local buckling pattern.

      XSTAGS must be less than or equal to the axial length of the
      panel or shell used in the PANDA2 model.

97.1  Panel length in the plane of the screen, L2
97.2 
      For a cylindrical panel, this is the arc length along the
      circumference of the entire panel.  A complete cylindrical
      shell can be modelled by using  L2 = pi*radius. Then the number
      of half-waves over this circumferential length is the same as
      the number of full waves around the complete 360 degree circum-
      ference.  If you are analyzing a complete cylindrical shell,
      especially one with loads that vary around the circumference,
      it will probably be best to divide it into panels. Then analyze
      the panel as a structure subjected to multiple sets of uniform
      loads.  (See the paper, PANDA2--program for minimum weight
      design of stiffened, composite, locally buckled panels, for an
      example. Computers and Structures, Vol. 25, pp 570-574, Fig. 79)
      
98.1  Number of modules in the STAGS finite element model, NSTIF
98.2 
      It may be a good idea to start with a small model. Try using
      NSTIF = 1 at first, then increase NSTIF as you gain insight
      into the behavior of the panel.

      This input datum is used in STAGSMODEL. The width of the panel
      modelled with the STAGS computer program is assumed to be
      NSTIF times the stringer spacing b(1). The "overhang" at the
      two longitudinal edges of the panel is b(1)/2. The following
      boundary conditions hold if the user indicates in the interactive
      STAGSMODEL session that he/she wants to use the wide column model
      for general instability: if there are less than 3 stringers,
      symmetry conditions are applied at the longitudinal edges; if
      there are three or more stringers, the normal displacement w and
      the three rotation components Ru,Rv,Rw at EGDE 1 are held equal
      to w,Ru,Rv,Rw, respectively, at midbay two bays to the right and
      w,Ru,Rv,Rw at EDGE 2 are held equal to w,Ru,Rv,Rw, at midbay two
      bays to the left.

 99.1 Length of the ring-stiffened cylindrical shell, L1
 99.2 
      Bear in mind that if the cylindrical shell has too many rings
      in it you may exceed the maximum number of segments allowed
      by BOSOR4.

      The stiffened panel is considered to be divided into several
      identical modules, as follows:
               ___                  ___                   ___
                |                    |                     |

      --------=====----------------=====-----------------=====---------
      |<---Module No. 1-->|<-- Module No. 2 --->|<--- Module No. 3 -->|

      For a module you will be asked to provide the following data:
         1. width,  b, of the module (same as stiffener spacing)
         2. width, b2, of the thickened region at the base of the
            stiffener (shown as ====== above).
         3. height, h, of the stiffener
         4. width,  w, of the outstanding flange of the stiffener, if any
         5. number of unique segments in the module (4 in above figure)
         6. For each unique segment of the module:
             6.1 number of layers thru thickness
             6.2 layer type indicator for each layer
             6.3 For each new layer type:
                   6.3.1 thickness
                   6.3.2 winding angle (which means layup angle)
                   6.3.3 material type indicator

102.0 
      You have chosen the ISOGRID option for type of stiffener.
      For this type of stiffener only the IQUICK=1 (PANDA-type
      closed form analysis) is available. No local postbuckling is
      permitted. If you are comparing the relative merits of the
      ISOGRID configuration with the more conventional stringer,ring
      configurations, make sure to base all your comparisons on
      the IQUICK = 1 mode of analysis. Otherwise you may reach
      the wrong conclusion about which configuration is best.

      NOTE: With the ISOGRID option it is assumed by PANDA2 that
            there is no base of width b2 under the stiffener. You
            are asked to provide input data only for the web and
            the outstanding flange, if any. The cross section
            dimensions, layups, material, and temperature of all
            three sets of stiffeners in the isogrid are assumed
            to be identical.

      ANOTHER NOTE: With the ISOGRID option the stiffener spacing b
                    is the height of the equilateral triangle formed
                    by the panel skin between stiffeners, NOT the
                    dimension of one side of the equilateral triangle.

103.1 Identify type of isogrid stiffener cross section (T, J, Z, R)
103.2 
      With the Isogrid configuration, only T-shaped, J-shaped, or
      Z-shaped or rectangular (blade) cross sections are available.

104.1 Choose orientation (ISOANG = 1 or 2) of isogrid
104.2 
      ISOANG = 1 means that one stiffener runs in the circumferential
                 direction (parallel to the plane of the screen -
                 in the y direction or L2 direction, called "90-degree"
                 stiffener, or stiffener no. 3 in the output.).
                 The other two stiffeners are at +30 deg. and -30 deg.
                 with respect to the axial direction.
                 Stiffener no. 1 is the +30-degree stiffener;
                 Stiffener no. 2 is the -30-degree stiffener;
                 Stiffener no. 3 is the  90-degree (circumf) stiffener.

      ISOANG = 2 means that one stiffener runs in the axial direction
                 (normal to the plane of the screen - in the x
                 direction or L1 direction, called "0-degree"
                 stiffener, or stiffener no. 3 in the output).
                 The other two stiffeners are at +60 deg. and -60 deg.
                 with respect to the axial direction.
                 Stiffener no. 1 is the +60-degree stiffener;
                 Stiffener no. 2 is the -60-degree stiffener;
                 Stiffener no. 3 is the   0-degree (axial) stiffener.

108.0 
      You will next be asked if you really want to analyze a panel
      with only one stringer. If you answer "Y" then PANDA2 will assume
      that this one-stringer panel is simply supported along the two
      longitudinal edges (the two edges normal to the screen, that is,
      the two edges parallel to the one stringer). The stringer is always
      placed at the midwidth of the panel. This is a rather strange case,
      and you should ask yourself if this one-stringer panel with simply
      supported longitudinal edges really represents with a fair degree
      of accuracy the actual structure that you want to analyze and/or
      design. For example, you should ask yourself, "Is the assumption of
      simple support along the two longitudinal edges reasonable?" In
      a panel with only a single stringer, the true boundary conditions
      along the two longitudinal edges have a lot of influence on the
      behavior of the panel. PANDA2 may not be the proper tool to obtain
      the optimum design in this case.

      NOTE: In the one-stringer case the stringer spacing b is not
      permitted to be a decision variable.

109.1 Do you really want to analyze a panel with only one stringer?
109.2 
      It is not advisable to do this. Proceed at your own risk.

110.1 Identify type of stiffener along L1 (N,T,J,Z,R,A,C,G)
110.2  
      L1 is the length of the panel normal to the plane of the screen.
      For choice "G" (isoGrid) L1 is irrelevant.

      N = no stiffeners along L1 at all
      T = T-shaped cross section
      J = J-shaped cross section (or angle with flange away from skin)
      Z = Z-shaped cross section with riveted faying flange
      R = rectangular cross section (blade stiffener)
      A = hat-shaped or trapezoidal cross section (enclosing area)
      C = Truss-core sandwich construction (added July 1989)
      G = isoGrid (added September 1992). With isoGrid the stiffeners
          can be T-shaped, J-shaped, or rectangular (blade).

111.0 
      Next, you will be asked to provide input data for stiffeners
      along the length L2, where L2 is the arc length of the panel in
      the plane of the screen.

112.1 Identify type of stiffener along L2  (N, T, J, Z, R, A)
112.2  
      L2 is the arc length of the panel in the plane of the screen.

      N = no stiffeners along L2 at all
      T = T-shaped cross section
      J = J-shaped cross section (or angle with flange away from skin)
      R = rectangular cross section (blade stiffener)
      Z = Z-shaped cross section with bonded faying flange
      A = hat-shaped or trapezoidal cross section (enclosing area)

113.1 Do you intend to design or analyze a beam (Type H(elp))?
113.2 
      If you answer Y, PANDA2 treats a panel of width equal to a
      single skin-stringer module (width, CIRC = stringer spacing b)
      as a beam, not as a panel (except see the next paragraph).
      In the analysis of a beam, the panel skin and stiffener faying
      flange (if any) are treated as part of the beam cross section.
      In the "beam" analysis, the boundary conditions along the two
      longitudinal edges of what would have been the panel skin in
      the treatment of a multi-module panel are set to free-free. (In
      the model of local buckling of the multi-module panel, symmetry
      is used as the boundary conditions along these two longitudinal
      edges). 

      If you answer N, PANDA2 first asks if you want to analyze a
      panel with only one stringer (warning you not to do this). If you
      do not, then PANDA2 aborts the run. In that case you should start
      over and either increase the width CIRC or decrease the stringer
      spacing b so that there are at least two modules, each of width
      b spanning the total width of the panel, CIRC. Don't worry about
      computer time. It does not depend on the number of skin-stringer
      modules contained in the width CIRC. Nor do you have to be
      concerned that the number of modules exactly fits into the total
      width CIRC.

114.1 Number of nodes in the next panel module segment: NNODES
114.2 
      NNODES is the number of nodes, including both end nodes,
      along the y-coordinate in the current segment of the cross
      section of the single panel module.

      NNODES must be an odd number.

      For the panel skin between stringers (first and last segments
      in the sketch above) use a minimum of 5 nodes per half wave
      of the local buckling pattern.

      For the stringer webs and flanges use a minimum of 3 nodes.

143.1 width of stringer base, b2 (must be > 0, see Help)
143.2 
      Width b2 must be greater than zero.  In fact, it should always
      be greater than a tenth of the module width, b. This segment of
      the module is considered by PANDA2 to consist of the skin plus
      the faying flange, if any, of the stiffener. In the PANDA2
      model b2 must be greater than about a tenth of the total module
      width, b, because the section of width b2 is considered to be
      a separate segment which is discretized. If you make b2 too
      small, numerical difficulties might occur.

      If the panel skin in the width b2 has the SAME CONSTRUCTION
      as that outside this region, set b2 to a value about b/3. IN
      THIS CASE, IN "DECIDE" MAKE SURE TO LINK THE WIDTH OF b2 TO
      THE SPACING, b:
                        b2 = C*b

      IN WHICH  C  IS THE LINKING CONSTANT.  (SET C = APPROXIMATELY 0.3)

144.1 width of ring base, b2 (zero is allowed)
144.2 
      If the ring has a faying flange (flange next to skin) b2 must be
      greater than zero. If b2 is greater than zero and the layers of
      the panel skin are orthotropic, then you must be sure declare new
      layer types and to provide their thicknesses, winding angles, and
      material types.  Later, in DECIDE, you must not forget to link
      these thicknesses and winding angles to those of the same layers
      already provided in the skin-stringer module, since these layers
      represent the same material.

      For example, suppose Layer 5 of the ring base b2 is the same as
      Layer 1 of the panel skin.  Suppose this layer is laid up at an
      angle of 30 degrees with respect to the axial (x) direction. When
      you provided input for the skin-stringer cross section, you declared
      the thickness and winding angle and material type of this layer.
      Later, in DECIDE, you must link the thickness and winding angle of
      Layer 5 Segment 2 of the skin-ring cross section to the thickness
      and winding angle of Layer 1 of Segment 1 of the skin-stringer
      cross section, with linking constants C = 1.0, thus:
               (Variable no. j)  = 1.0*(Variable no. i)             (1)
               (Variable no. n)  = 1.0*(Variable no. m) - 90.       (2)
      in which Eq. (1) is the linking expression for the thicknesses and
      Eq. (2) is the linking expression for the winding angles:
        Variable j = thickness of Layer 5, Segment 2, skin-ring module
        Variable i = thickness of Layer 1, Segment 1, skin-stringer module
        Variable n = winding angle of Layer 5, Seg. 2, skin-ring module
        Variable m = winding angle of Layer 1, Seg. 1, skin-stringer module

145.1 height of stiffener (type H for sketch), h

      If you answer Y then it will be assumed that the layers in Seg. 2
      are bonded to both the bottom and top face sheets only over the
      widths b2 of Segments 5 and 6, respectively. Segs. 1 and 3 are
      thinner than Segs. 5 and 6 by the thickness of the web.

150.1 width of outstanding flange of stiffener, w
152.1 width of hat base, w2
153.1 Does the wall under the hat have the same layup as Segment 1?
153.2 
      If your answer is yes, then Segment 2 consists of two different
      wall constructions:
        1. that of each of the two portions of total width b2 - w2 that
           lies outside the hat consists of the wall in Segment 1 plus
           one of the faying flanges of the hat.
        2. that of the portion under the hat of width w2.
      If your answer is yes, use the wall construction in Segment 2
      outside of the hat (portions with faying flanges) for your input
      for Segment 2.

      If your answer is no, then Segment 2 is assumed to be of uniform
      wall construction. Use the wall construction under the hat for
      your input for Segment 2.

154.1 Are the stringers cocured with the skin?
154.2 
      Stringers and skin may be cured separately, then glued
      together at room temperature, or they may be cocured. Which
      method is used very much affects the residual stresses and
      residual deformations of the panel. The residual stresses
      and deformations in cocured panels are caused by the different
      thermal expansion properties of the stringers and skin as the
      panel cools down from the curing temperature to room tempera-
      ture. If this is not a composite panel, the answer here should
      probably be N.

155.1 Is the isogrid cocured with the skin?
155.2 
      Isogrid stiffeners and skin may be cured separately, then glued
      together at room temperature, or they may be cocured. Which
      method is used very much affects the residual stresses and
      residual deformations of the panel. The residual stresses
      and deformations in cocured panels are caused by the different
      thermal expansion properties of the isogrid and skin as the
      panel cools down from the curing temperature to room tempera-
      ture. If this is not a composite panel, the answer here should
      probably be N.

156.1 Are the rings cocured with the skin?
156.2
      Rings and skin may be cured separately, then glued
      together at room temperature, or they may be cocured. Which
      method is used very much affects the residual stresses and
      residual deformations of the panel. The residual stresses
      and deformations in cocured panels are caused by the different
      thermal expansion properties of the rings and skin as the
      panel cools down from the curing temperature to room tempera-
      ture. If this is not a composite panel, the answer here should
      probably be N.

157.1 Knockdown factor for hat torsional stiffness, PHIHAT
157.2 
      For "empty" hats (no foam filler) use PHIHAT = 0.3
      For hats filled with foam, try using  PHIHAT = 0.6

      The torsional stiffness of the wall, which plays a big
      role in the C66 term of the integrated constitutive law,
      is almost proportional to PHIHAT for a hat-shaped
      stiffener. PHIHAT does not enter the computations of
      the C66 term for panels with stiffeners with open cross
      sections, such as blades, Tees, Jays, Zees.

      If you are running a PANDA2 case to compare with results
      from BOSOR4 in which the hat stringers are smeared out,
      use PHI = 0.3 because that is what BOSOR4 uses in models
      with smeared hat stiffeners.

158.1 What force/(axial length) will cause web peel-off?
158.2 
      Irrelevant for ISOGRID configuration.

      Wanted here is the force-per-axial-length of stringer required
      to peel half of each stringer web and faying flange away from the
      panel skin. "Half the stringer web" means half of the thickness.
      It is assumed that each half of the stringer web consists of
      layers that start as part or all of the faying flange on either
      side of the stiffener. These layers "turn a corner" to become
      the stringer web. Tensile forces in the plane of the web,
      normal to the stringer axis, will therefore tend to peel the
      web halves from the faying flanges from which they derive.
      In the post-local buckling regime, such forces develop in each
      stringer web. These are calculated by PANDA2, and a constraint
      condition is formulated that indicates whether or not stringer
      popoff will occur because of web-peel-off caused by post-local
      buckling deformations. The force required here depends on what
      sort of adhesive is used between stringers and skin and its
      thickness.  You will probably have to consult peel test data for
      this input datum.  Units required are force/length.  A typical
      value for graphite-epoxy is in the range 40-100 lb/in. Figures
      5 and 6 of the paper, ``PANDA2--program for minimum weight
      design of stiffened, composite, locally buckled panels" show
      the phenomenon just described and a peel-test specimen.  Figure
      7 is a photograph of a graphite-epoxy peel test specimen after
      failure.

159.1 Knockdown factor for truss-core torsional stiffness, PHITRS
159.2
      For "empty" truss-core (no foam filler) use PHITRS = 0.3
      For truss-core filled with foam, try using  PHITRS = 0.6

      The torsional stiffness of the wall, which plays a big
      role in the C66 term of the integrated constitutive law,
      is almost proportional to PHITRS for a truss-core sandwich 
      wall. PHITRS does not enter the computations of
      the C66 term for panels with stiffeners with open cross
      sections, such as blades, Tees, Jays, Zees.

160.0 
      Now you will be asked to provide properties for the panel
      module on a segment-by-segment basis, starting with the
      skin, which is Segment 1, as shown in the Figure above.
      In each segment of the module, the wall is considered to be
      divided into groups of layers. There are two types of groups:
       1. default groups (12 layers, [90,0,45,-45,0,90]s, all of the
          same material and initially all of the same thickness.
          If you choose this option, winding angles cannot be decision
          variables. Thicknesses can be decision variables.);
       2. just plain groups (any number of layers, any winding angles,
          any variety of material types and any variety of thickness.
          Winding angles CAN be decision variables.)
      For each default group (group type 1) you will be asked to give:
       1. the thickness of one of the layers;
       2. the material type.
      For each "just plain group" (group type 2) you must provide:
       1. the number of layers through the thickness of the group
       2. whether the winding angles can ever be decision variables
       3. layer indices for each layer
       4. whether the layer is a new type of layer
       5. if it is a new type of layer: thickness, winding angle,
          and material type corresponding to that layer index.

      Next, provide the properties of Segment 2, which is the
      base under the stiffener.  This base includes the skin
      under the stiffener plus the stiffener flange that fays with
      the skin, except in the case of a hat with b2 = w2, for which
      the "base" is simply the laminate under the hat.

      ***** IMPORTANT NOTE *****

      At least one of the layers in Segment 2 should ordinarily be
      the same as one of the layers in Segment 1. If Segment 2
      represents a thickened region under the stiffener, model it as
      being composed of the layers in Segment 1 plus additional layer(s).
      NOTE: There is an exception when the user wants to take advantage
      of "bending overshoot" in stress constraints. For details, see

      Next, provide the properties of Segment 4    4    4    4    4...

164.1 Is the next group of layers to be a "default group" (12 layers!)?
164.2 
      N   means that you will provide a group of layers one-by-one.
          (This is the answer you will probably most often give. Note
           that you MUST answer N if you want winding angles to be
           decision variables in an optimization analysis.)

      Y   means that a group of layers will be generated each of
          which initially has the same thickness and material type.
          You will be asked to provide this single layer thickness
          and this material type indicator. Winding angles cannot
          be decision variables.

          A "default group" has 12 layers of initially equal
          thickness with winding angles in the sequence:
 
          [90,0,45,-45,0,90]s =  [90,0,45,-45,0,90,90,0,-45,45,0,90]

          Note that the thicknesses of the individual layers, which
          are initially the same in a default group, can become 
          different during optimization iterations.

165.1 Is the next group of layers to be a "default group"?
165.2 
      The wall can be built up entirely of default groups or a
      mixture of default groups and "just plain groups".

166.1 number of layers in the next group in Segment no.
166.2  
      NOTE: the maximum number of layers total is 90.

167.0 
      CAUTION!!!
            If some of the layers in Segment 2 of the skin-ring
            panel module are orthotropic, you may have to
            introduce new layer types for these layers even if they
            are physically the same as some or all of the layers of
            the skin-stringer module.  This is because the definition
            of winding angle is: the angle measured from the normal to
            the screen to the direction in which the fiber modulus E1
            is measured.  Thus, for Segment 2 only, what were 0-degree
            layers of the skin-stringer module become 90-degree layers
            of the skin-ring module; what were 90-deg. layers of the
            skin-stringer module become 0-deg. layers; and what were
            +45-deg. layers become -45-deg. layers and -45-deg. layers
            become +45-deg. layers. If the material is isotropic you
            don't need to bother with this warning.

168.1 Can winding (layup) angles ever be decision variables?
168.2 
      The term "winding angle" is used throughout PANDA2. However,
      PANDA2 assumes that the composite laminates are "laid up"
      layer by layer, with each layer having a distinct and constant
      angle between the axial direction (normal to the screen) and
      the direction of the fibers (high modulus direction). Hence,
      the composite structure is not wound but built up
      layer by layer.  Fig. 2 of the journal article on PANDA shows
      the geometry. (See the article, "PANDA--interactive program
      for minimum weight design of stiffened cylindrical panels and
      shells", Computers and Structures, vol 16, pp 167-185, 1983)

      Use with caution. Please note that weight does not change with
      winding angle, so that if you plan to optimize something and
      allow winding angles to be decision variables, you must also allow
      the thickness of at least one layer also to be a decision variable.

      Also, any decision variable that is zero or that becomes zero during
      design iterations is dropped by PANDA2 from the list of decision
      variables:  It ceases being a decision variable from that moment on.
      Hence, if you specify that the winding angle of a layer is a decision
      variable, and if you also specify that the winding angle of this
      layer is zero, this layer winding angle will not be a decision
      variable during optimization cycles. If you really want the layer
      winding angle to be a decision variable, set it initially to 5 or 10
      degrees or use CHANGE to change it from zero to 5 or 10 degrees.  

169.0 
      Next, provide the properties of Segment 2    2    2    2    2...

170.1 layer index (1,2,...), for layer no.
170.2  
      A layer index implies the following "bundle" of properties:

         1. thickness of the layer
         2. winding (layup) angle of the layer (degrees between the
            normal to the screen and the direction in which the
            modulus E1 (fiber direction) is measured)
         3. material type of the layer

      The three properties just listed are identical in two different
      layers if both of these layers have the same layer index.

172.1 Is this a new layer type?
173.1 Is this default group identical to a previous group?
173.2 
      If this is your first default group, answer N.

      NOTE: The previous group referred to must be in the same
      module. That is, you cannot have a group in the skin-ring
      module identical to a group in the skin-stringer module.

      ANOTHER NOTE: By "identical" is meant that sequence of thick-
      nesses, winding angles, and material type will always be the
      same in the present group as they were in the previous group.
      This means the present group will be identical to the previous
      group throughout any optimization iterations, not just to begin
      with.

174.1 Which module segment is the previous group in?
174.2 
      Identify the part of the module which contains the identical
      group. Note that it had to be treated as a default group and
      not as a sequence of individual user-provided layers.

175.1 Which default group in that segment is the same?
175.2 
      If there is only one default group in that previous segment, then
      enter 1. If there is more than one default group in that
      previous segment, then enter which group it is.

176.0  
      thickness, winding angle, material for layer index

180.1 thickness for layer index no.
181.1 thickness of each layer of the default group
181.2 
      Remember, the default group has 12 layers. Don't make the
      single layer thickness too large, or many iterations during
      optimization may be required. A good minimum thickness for
      composite material is 0.005 inches.

      All layers in the default group initially have the same
      thickness.

183.1 winding angle (deg.) for layer index no.
183.2 
      The definition of winding angle is: the angle in degrees
      measured from the normal to the screen to the direction in
      which the fiber modulus E1 is measured.

      The term "winding angle" is used throughout PANDA2. However,
      PANDA2 assumes that the composite laminates are "laid up"
      layer by layer, with each layer having a distinct and constant
      angle between the axial direction (normal to the screen) and
      the direction of the fibers (high modulus direction). Hence,
      the composite structure is not wound but built up
      layer by layer.  Fig. 2 of the journal article on PANDA shows
      the geometry. (See the article, "PANDA--interactive program
      for minimum weight design of stiffened cylindrical panels and
      shells", Computers and Structures, vol 16, pp 167-185, 1983)

184.1 material index (1,2,...) for layer index no.
184.2 
      What is required here is an integer. This integer is a pointer
      to a material, the properties of which will be asked of you
      later. The integer must be greater than or equal to 1  .

185.1 material type in the default group
185.2 
      NOTE: all layers in the default group are assumed to be of
      the same material.

186.1 Any more layers or groups of layers in Segment no.
186.2 
      NOTE: the total number of layers permitted is 90. Answer "Y"
            if you want to add substiffeners.

187.1 Does one of the additional layers consist of sub-stiffeners?
187.2
      Answer Y or N.

      A "layer" that has sub-stiffeners consists of up to two sets of
      substiffeners, each set with rectangular cross section. There is
      no "skin" in this "layer", just 1 or 2 sets of uniformly
      spaced rectangular beams or a single isogrid set of substiffeners. 

      These substiffeners are in addition to any
      "regular" stiffeners (stringers and/or rings), such as the kind that
      form segments of a skin-stringer or skin-ring module and may have
      various cross sections (blade, tee, jay, zee, hat). However, the
      substiffeners MUST have rectangular cross sections. 

      The substiffeners are attached to the already-defined
      panel skin. You cannot embed substiffener "layers" between two skin 
      layers. You cannot "stack" substiffener "layers".

      If you answer Y, PANDA2 will next ask you to supply the following
      data [in which i = ith substiffener set (i = 1 or 2)

      TSUB(i)  = thickness of substiffeners in ith set.
      HSUB(i)  = height of substiffeners in ith set.
      THSUB(i) = angle (degrees) of substiffeners in ith set.
      BSUB(i)  = spacing of substiffeners in ith set.
      MATSUB(i)= material index of substiffeners in ith set.
      NSURF(i) = index for which skin surface substiffeners are attached to.
      NB2(i)   = index for whether substiffeners extend over the B2 region.

188.1 Does this sub-stiffener "layer" form an isogrid?
188.2 
      If "Y", then the cross sections of each substiffener member have
      the same dimensions, (TSUB,HSUB), spacings BSUB, and material index,
      MATSUB.

      For an isogrid substiffener assembly the following rules apply:

       a. THSUB(1) = 0.    or
       b. THSUB(1) = 90.  

      With THSUB(1) = 0., one member of the three identical isogrid members
      is oriented axially (the same as the ISOANG=2 choice in the case for
      which the major stiffeners form an isogrid).

      With THSUB(1) = 90., one member of the three is oriented circumferentially,
      (the same as the ISOANG = 1 choice when the major stiffeners form an
      isogrid.

189.0
      A "layer" that has sub-stiffeners consists of up to two sets of
      substiffeners, each set with rectangular cross section. There is no skin
      in this type of "layer", just 1 or 2 sets of uniformly spaced
      substiffeners or a single set forming an isogrid pattern.
      
      These substiffeners are IN ADDITION to any "regular" 
      stiffeners, that is, stringers and/or rings which may have any of several
      different cross sections, such as blades, tees, jays, zees, or hats. The
      substiffeners MUST be of rectangular cross section and have no base
      (no faying flange). 

      You are NOT allowed to "stack" substiffener layers. If you have two
      substiffener "layers" (the most allowed), one "layer" must be attached
      to one side of the already-defined panel skin and the other to the other
      side of the panel skin. (You cannot embed a substiffener "layer" between
      skin layers. In a given panel segment you cannot have one isogrid
      substiffener "layer" and one non-isogrid substiffener "layer".
      
      PANDA2 will next ask you to supply the following data
      [in which i = ith substiffener set (i = 1 or 2) 

      TSUB(i)  = thickness of substiffeners in ith set
                   (dimension parallel to plane of the skin).
      HSUB(i)  = height of substiffeners in ith set
                   (dimension normal to the plane of the skin).
      THSUB(i) = angle (degrees) of substiffeners in ith set
                   (THSUB = 0. means substiffener runs in axial direction; 
                    THSUB =90. means circumferential direction).
      BSUB(i)  = spacing of substiffeners in ith set
                   (BSUB is measured normal to the axis of the substiffener).
      MATSUB(i)= material index of substiffeners in ith set.
      NSURF(i) = index for which skin surface substiffeners are attached to
                   (NSURF = 0 means substiffeners attached to layer no. 1;
                    NSURF = 1 means substiffeners attached to layer no. n).
      NB2(i)   = index for whether substiffeners extend over the B2 region
                   (B2 is the base under the "regular" stiffener.
                    NB2 = 0 means substiffeners do not extend over B2;
                    NB2 = 1 means substiffeners do extend over B2).

      NOTE: The rectangular substiffeners have no thickened bases beneath them
      (no faying flanges). Permissible angles are (0 and 90) degrees.
      In the case of a subisogrid array the angle (0 or 90) that you give
      identifies the orientation of the isogrid (one member axial or one member
      circumferential). In the case of a subisogrid array you are allowed only
      one set of substiffeners, not two sets.

      In the case of substiffener sets oriented either axially or circum-
      ferentially (non-subisogrid array) each set can have its own cross
      section, that is, axially oriented (0-degree) substiffeners can have
      a different rectangular cross section from circumferentially oriented
      (90-degree) substiffeners.

190.1 Index, NSURF = 0 or 1, for substiffener "layer"
190.2 
      NSURF = 0 means substiffener "layer" is attached to top of
                Layer No. 1 of the panel skin. Also, NSURF = 0
                means that the substiffener is attached to the
                same surface as the major stringer. Please see Fig.
                8 on p. 490 of the long 1987 PANDA2 paper,
                "PANDA2- program for minimum weight design..." for
                orientation of a major stringer and panel skin.

      NSURF = 1 means substiffener "layer" is attached to bottom of
                Layer No. NLAYERS of the panel skin. Also, NSURF = 1
                means that the substiffener is attached to the
                opposite surface from the major stringer.

191.1 Index, NB2 = 0 or 1, for substiffener "layer"
191.2 
      NB2 = 0 means substiffener "layer" does NOT extend over either
              the "regular" stringer base or the "regular" ring base.
      NB2 = 1 means substiffener "layer" DOES extend over both the
              "regular" stringer base and the "regular" ring base.

192.1 Thickness, TSUB, of substiffener set
192.2
      Thickness is the dimension parallel to the plane of the panel skin.
      NOTE: The cross section MUST be rectangular.

193.1 Height, HSUB, of substiffener set
193.2
      Height is the dimension normal to the plane of the panel skin.
      NOTE: The cross section MUST be rectangular.

194.1 Angle, THSUB (degrees), of substiffener set
194.2 
      The angle, THSUB (degrees), is measured from the panel axial direction
      (normal to the screen) to the coordinate along the substiffener axis,
      positive in the same sense that a layer layup angle is positive in the
      case of a composite lamina. Note that only THSUB = 0 or 90 are allowed.
      THSUB = 0 means substringers; THSUB = 90 means subrings. In the case of
      a subisogrid array, THSUB determines the orientation of the subisogrid.

195.1 Spacing, BSUB, of substiffener set
195.2 
      Spacing BSUB is measured normal to the substiffener axis.

196.1 Material type, MATSUB,  for substiffener set
196.2 
      Use an integer, just as with material type for a layer
      of the panel skin.

197.1 Are there any more substiffener sets in substiffener "layer"
197.2 
      You are allowed up to two substiffener sets if the substiffener
      layer is NOT an isogrid, one substiffener set in which the
      substiffeners are oriented axially and other substiffener
      set in which the substiffeners are oriented circumferentially.
      Of course, you may also have only one substiffener set, oriented
      either axially or circumferentially.

      For a subisogrid you are allowed only one substiffener "layer". 

198.1 Are there any more substiffener "layers"?
198.2 
      You are allowed AT MOST two substiffener "layers". If you have
      two substiffener "layers", they must be attached to opposite
      sides of the panel skin. You cannot "stack" substiffener layers.

199.1 Will you use "bending overshoot" in Segment 1?
199.2 
      Ordinarily you will answer this question "N".
      See ...panda2/doc/panda2.news ITEM 299 for details about
      "bending overshoot". 

200.1 choose external (0) or internal (1) stringers
200.2  
      If the panel is flat, choose "external" (0).

      If the panel is cylindrical, choose either 0 or 1.
      See Fig. 8, p. 490, of the long 1987 PANDA2 paper for geometry.
      If you choose 0 ("external"), then the radius of curvature of the
      panel will be regarded as positive. (Referring to the sketch of the
      single panel module, the concave surface of the panel skin will be
      the bottom surface.)  If you choose 1 ("internal)", then the radius
      of curvature of the panel will be regarded as negative. (The bottom
      surface in the panel module sketch will be convex.)

202.1 choose external (0) or internal (1) isogrid stiffeners
202.2  
      If the panel is flat, choose "external" (0).

      If the panel is cylindrical, choose either 0 or 1.
      See Fig. 8, p. 490, of the long 1987 PANDA2 paper for geometry.
      If you choose 0 ("external"), then the radius of curvature of the
      panel will be regarded as positive. (Referring to the sketch of the
      single panel module, the concave surface of the panel skin will be
      the bottom surface.)  If you choose 1 ("internal)", then the radius
      of curvature of the panel will be regarded as negative. (The bottom
      surface in the panel module sketch will be convex.)

205.1 choose external (0) or internal (1) rings
205.2 
      The "HELP" comment given for the stringers or isogrid does not
      apply here.

         a. If there are stringers, the ring cross section will lie
            above the panel skin if the rings are on the same side
            of the skin as the stringers. If stringers and rings are
            on opposite sides of the skin, the ring cross section will
            lie below the panel skin.

      If the panel is cylindrical:
         b. If there are no stringers, the radius of curvature will be
            positive, that is, the concave surface of the panel skin
            will be the bottom surface. (See panel module sketch).
         
         c. If there are stringers, the sign of the panel curvature is
            governed by whether they are external or internal, and the
            location of the ring cross section is governed by a. (above).

215.1 Is the panel curved in the plane of the screen (Y for cyls.)?
215.2 
      We are referring here to the module cross section.  Is the
      skin curved as we look at the module cross section? If this
      is a cylindrical panel rather than a flat panel your answer
      should be Y.

220.1 Radius of curvature (cyl. rad.) in the plane of screen, R
220.2 
      We are referring here to the module cross section.  Is the
      skin curved as we look at the module cross section?  If this
      is a cylindrical panel or shell, the radius asked for is the
      radius of the cylinder measured to the middle surface of the
      skin.  ALWAYS USE A POSITIVE NUMBER!

222.1 Is panel curved normal to plane of screen? (answer N)
222.2 
      We are referring here to curvature in the direction normal
      to the plane of the module cross section.  Please answer N
      now. If you are analyzing a cylindrical panel, make the panel
      curved in the plane of the screen only.

223.1 Radius of curvature normal to plane of screen, R2
223.2 
      We are referring here to curvature in the direction normal
      to the plane of the module cross section.  Please go back and
      correct your case, answering the previous question N instead
      of Y.

225.0  
      You will next be asked to provide material properties corres-
      ponding to the material types that you have already indicated.

227.0  
      Next material type...

230.1 Is this material isotropic (Y or N)?
232.1 Young's modulus,                 E
234.1 Poisson's ratio,                NU
235.1 transverse shear modulus,      G13
235.2 
      For this isotropic material, please use G13 = G, the in-plane
      shear modulus, unless you have good reason not to do so.

236.1 Thermal expansion coeff.,    ALPHA
237.1 residual stress temperature (positive),TEMPTUR
237.2 
      Degrees must be consistent with thermal expansion coefficients,
      A1 and A2 given previously.  What is wanted here is the
      difference between the setting temperature and room temperature,
      that is, the delta temperature that governs the magnitude of
      residual stresses and deformations in the panel due to curing.
      TEMPTUR should be zero or positive.
  
238.1 Want to supply a stress-strain "curve" for this mat'l (H)?
238.2 
      Please use elastic properties only unless you want to
      simulate the cold-bending fabrication process. (See Item

      The stress-strain curve is used ONLY in the analysis of
      cold-bending. (See Item No. 790 in ...panda2/doc/panda2.news).
      PANDA2 does not account for plasticity or nonlinear stress-
      strain curves in its ordinary buckling and stress analyses,
      even if you choose to provide a stress-strain curve here..

      The stress-strain curve is used ONLY for generating a buckling
      constraint condition for buckling of an INTERNAL Tee-shaped or
      rectangular ring during the cold-bending of a flat plate with
      "hogged out" pockets that form stiffeners into a cylindrical
      panel.

      If you want to simulate the cold-bending process:

      1. The entire structure must be fabricated from the same
         isotropic material. (You can supply more than one
         material type in the PANDA2 model, but all material types
         must have the same isotropic elastic properties.)

      2. If in the PANDA2 model you plan to introduce more than
         one material type (in order to identify what the maximum
         stresses are in the various parts of the shell structure)
         the stress-strain curve must be supplied ONLY FOR THE 
         FIRST MATERIAL TYPE in the PANDA2 model, that is, for
         material index no. 1 . All other material types must
         correspond to elastic, isotropic materials with the
         same elastic properties as those of material type 1 .

      NOTE: The stress-strain curve is assumed to be the same
            for both tension and compression.

      Next, supply a table of (strain, stress) values, starting with
      (0., 0.).   Maximum of 20 (strain, stress) pairs permitted.

240.1 strain coordinate for stress-strain "curve", strain
240.2
      NOTE: the first strain entry must be zero.
      NOTE: the second strain entry (the first non-zero entry)
      must have the value: strain(2) = stress(proportional limit)/E.

241.1 stress coordinate for stress-strain "curve", stress
241.2
      NOTE: the first stress entry must be zero.
      NOTE: the second stress entry (the first non-zero entry)
      must have the value: stress(2) = stress(proportional limit).

242.1 any more (strain, stress) pairs (Y or N)?
243.0 
      In the following:

        E1 = modulus in the fiber direction
        E2 = modulus transverse to fibers in the plane of the layer
         G = in-plane shear modulus
        NU = Poisson's ratio: NU = NU12 = NU21 * E2/E1
             NOTE: the NU you provide is the smallest of the two if
                   E1 > E2.  This is a bit unusual, so BEWARE!
       G13 = transverse shear modulus for shear in plane normal
             to the fibers
       G23 = transverse shear modulus for shear in plane parallel
             to the fibers

244.1 modulus in the fiber direction, E1
245.1 modulus transverse to fibers,   E2
246.1 in-plane shear modulus,          G
247.1 small Poisson's ratio,          NU
248.1 out-of-plane shear modulus,    G13
248.2 
      This is the transverse shear modulus governing shear stiffness
      normal to the laminate in a plane parallel to the fibers.
      For unidirectional tape, you might use a value equal to or close
      to the in-plane shear modulus, G.

249.1 out-of-plane shear modulus,    G23
249.2 
      This is the transverse shear modulus governing shear stiffness
      normal to the laminate in a plane perpendicular to the fibers.
      For unidirectional tape, you might use 0.6 times the in-plane
      shear modulus, G.

250.1 thermal expansion along fibers, A1
251.1 transverse thermal expansion,   A2
252.1 residual stress temperature (positive),TEMPTUR
252.2 
      Degrees must be consistent with thermal expansion coefficients,
      A1 and A2 given previously.  What is wanted here is the
      difference between the setting temperature and room temperature,
      that is, the delta temperature that governs the magnitude of
      residual stresses and deformations in the panel due to curing.
      TEMPTUR should be zero or positive.
  
253.1 Want to specify  maximum effective stress ?
253.2  
      For isotropic material the answer is usually Y  .
      For orthotropic material the answer must be  N . In the ortho-
      tropic case you must specify maximum tensile and compressive
      and shear stresses in the principle material directions
      (along the fibers and normal to them).

254.1 Maximum allowable effective stress in material type
255.0 
      Next, you will be asked to provide six maximum allowable
      stresses:
         maximum tensile stress along fibers,         sig1(tension)
         maximum compressive stress along fibers,     sig1(comp.)
         maximum tensile stress normal to fibers,     sig2(tension)
         maximum compressive stress normal to fibers, sig2(comp.)
         maximum in-plane shear stress,               sig12
         maximum adhesive stress between layers       sigglue(tension)
      These maximum allowables correspond to a single lamina of
      composite material (tape or cloth). The thickness of a single
      lamina is often something like 0.005 inches. Later, you will
      be asked to provide input data regarding the degradation of
      these allowable maximum stresses with multiple adjacent layers
      with the same winding angle, since tests show that laminates
      consisting of multiple unidirectionally oriented layers are
      weaker than a single layer of the same material.  (Degradation
      does not apply to max. adhesive stress between layers.)

256.1 maximum tensile stress along fibers, matl
257.1 max compressive stress along fibers, matl
258.1 max tensile stress normal to fibers, matl  
259.1 max compress stress normal to fibers,matl  
260.1 maximum  shear  stress  in  material type                 
261.1 max. adhesive stress between layers, matl
261.2 
      For composite layup this maximum stress should be approximately
      equal to the maximum tensile stess normal to the fibers. When
      different materials are bonded together, just use the maximum
      tensile strength of the adhesive. This number is used to
      calculate a constraint for stringer popoff in the post-local
      buckling range.  If the panel is integrally stiffened (milled
      or machined stringers) use the maximum tensile stress along
      fibers for this allowable.

262.0 
      Sometimes optimum designs are obtained for composite laminates
      with models in which the ENTIRE LAMINATE is treated as one
      layer, rather than on a ply-by-ply basis. Input data for stress
      allowables are generally obtained from membrane and bending tests
      on the ENTIRE LAMINATE. Laminate tests usually reveal that the
      maximum bending stress before failure of the laminate is
      significantly larger than the maximum membrane stress. In order
      to exploit this "bending overshoot" during optimization, it is
      necessary to include stress constraints of the form:

      max.stress constraint = 1/[S(membrane)/S(a) +S(bending)/(f*S(a))]

      in which "S" means "stress" and "a" means "allowable". The quantity
      "f" is a "bending overshoot factor", which might be different for
      as many as five different conditions:

      1. S(membrane) is axial tensile; 2. S(membrane) is axial compressive
      3. S(membrane) is "hoop"tensile: 4. S(membrane) is "hoop"compressive
      5. S(membrane) is in-plane shear stress. 
      
      Accordingly, you will next be prompted whether or not you want to
      take advantage of "bending overshoot". If you answer "Y" and the
      current material does NOT have a single maximum allowable effective
      stress, you will then be prompted for the following five bending
      overshoot factors, fxt, fxc, fyt, fyc, fxy (each greater than unity):
            1. f(axial tensile) =fxt;   2. f(axial compressive) =fxc
            3. f("hoop" tensile)=fyt;   4. f("hoop" compressive)=fyc
            5. f(in-plane shear)=fxy
      "hoop" means normal to the axial direction in the plane of the
      panel module segment (the "s"- or "y"-coordinate in Fig. 9 of the
      long 1987 PANDA2 paper in Computers and Structures, pp 469-605).
      If you have previously indicated that the material has a single
      maximum "effective" stress (in the von Mises sense), then you
      will simply be prompted for one quantity, f, which is the single
      "bending overshoot" factor (greater than unity). NOTE: IF YOU
      ELECT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE "BENDING OVERSHOOT", YOU MUST TREAT
      THIS MATERIAL AS A DIFFERENT MATERIAL IF THE SAME MATERIAL APPEARS
      ELSEWHERE IN A MULTILAYER SEGMENT.

263.1 Do you want to take advantage of "bending overshoot"?
263.2 
      "Bending overshoot" means that the bending stress component
      of the total extreme fiber stress has a higher allowable than
      the membrane stress component. If you answer "Y" stress
      constraints of the following form will be used:
      max.stress constraint = 1/[S(membrane)/S(a) +S(bending)/(f*S(a))]
      and you will be prompted for the "bending overshoot" factor, "f",
      or factors, fxt, fxc, fyt, fyc, fxy (greater than unity).
      NOTE: IF YOU ELECT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE "BENDING OVERSHOOT",
      YOU MUST TREAT THIS MATERIAL AS A DIFFERENT MATERIAL IF THE SAME
      MATERIAL APPEARS ELSEWHERE IN A MULTILAYER SEGMENT.

264.1 "bending overshoot" factor for axial tension, fxt
264.2  
      fxt should be greater than unity. 1.3 is often used. The max.
      stress constraint for axial tension will have the form:
      max.stress constraint for axial tension =
        1/[S(membrane axial tension)/(S(allowable for axial tension))
          +S(axial bending)/(fxt*S(allowable for axial tension))]
      
265.1 "bending overshoot" factor for axial compression, fxc
265.2 
      fxc should be greater than unity. 1.3 is often used. The max.
      stress constraint for axial compression will have the form:
      max.stress constraint for axial compression =
       1/[S(membrane axial compression)/(S(allowable for axial compres.))
         +S(axial bending)/(fxc*S(allowable for axial compression))]
      
266.1 "bending overshoot" factor for "hoop" tension, fyt
266.2  
      fyt should be greater than unity. 1.3 is often used. The max.
      stress constraint for "hoop" tension will have the form:
      max.stress constraint for "hoop" tension =
       1/[S(membrane "hoop" tension)/(S(allowable for "hoop" tension))
         +S("hoop" bending)/(fyt*S(allowable for "hoop" tension))]
      
267.1 "bending overshoot" factor for "hoop" compression, fyc
267.2 
      fyc should be greater than unity. 1.3 is often used. The max.
      stress constraint for "hoop" compression will have the form:
      max.stress constraint for "hoop" compression =
      1/[S(membrane "hoop" compression)/(S(allowable for "hoop" compres.))
        +S("hoop" bending)/(fyc*S(allowable for "hoop" compression))]
      
268.1 "twisting overshoot" factor for in-plane shear, fxy
268.2 
      fxy should be greater than unity. 1.3 is often used. The max.
      stress constraint for in-plane shear will have the form:
      max.stress constraint for in-plane shear =
      1/[S(membrane in-plane shear)/(S(allowable for in-plane shear))
        +S(twisting)/(fxy*S(allowable for in-plane shear))]

269.1 "bending overshoot" factor, f
269.2 
      "f" should be greater than unity. 1.3 is often used. The max.
      stress constraint for effective stress is computed in a new
      subroutine (SUBROUTINE CONOVR) in the STRAIN library as follows:
     
      SIGAVX =0.5*(SIGXX(1)+SIGXX(2));  SIGDFX=0.5*(SIGXX(1)-SIGXX(2))
      SIGSMX =SIGAVX+SIGDFX/BNDOVR(1);  SIGMXX=SIGAVX-SIGDFX/BNDOVR(1)
      SIGAVY =0.5*(SIGYY(1)+SIGYY(2));  SIGDFY=0.5*(SIGYY(1)-SIGYY(2))
      SIGSMY =SIGAVY+SIGDFY/BNDOVR(1);  SIGMYY=SIGAVY-SIGDFY/BNDOVR(1)
      SIGAXY =0.5*(SIGXY(1)+SIGXY(2));  SIGDXY=0.5*(SIGXY(1)-SIGXY(2))
      SIGSXY =SIGAXY+SIGDXY/BNDOVR(1);  SIGMXY=SIGAXY-SIGDXY/BNDOVR(1)
      SIGEFF = SQRT(SIGSMX**2 +SIGSMY**2 -SIGSMX*SIGSMY +3.*SIGSXY**2)
      IF (SIGEFF.GT.0.) SIGC1 = EALLST(1)/SIGEFF
      SIGEFF = SQRT(SIGMXX**2 +SIGMYY**2 -SIGMXX*SIGMYY +3.*SIGMXY**2)
      IF (SIGEFF.GT.0.) SIGC2 = EALLST(1)/SIGEFF
      SIGC(1,J) = MIN(SIGC1,SIGC2)

270.1 Does cold bending include the outstanding ring flange? 
270.2
      If there are no outstanding ring flanges, answer "N".
      If the final fabricated panel or shell has rings with
      outstanding flanges, then read on.

      The cylindrical shell may be cold bent before outstanding
      flanges are welded on to the tips of the ring webs, or the
      outstanding ring flanges may be present during the cold
      bending process. If only the ring webs exist when the cold
      bending process takes place, then the analysis of buckling
      during the cold-bending process will be undertaken with the
      assumption that the flanges are made of very, very soft
      material and experience no prebuckling compression at all.

271.1 ring web radial compression, FN1WEB
271.2
      When the flat plate with "hogged out" pockets is formed into
      a cylindrical panel by cold bending, there may, during the
      cold-bending process, occur a compressive radial resultant,
      FN1WEB, generated. FN1WEB (units=force/length) is the maximum
      radial compression in a ring web during the cold-bending
      process.

      It is best for now to use zero: FN1WEB = 0.
      
272.1 weight density (greater than 0!) of material type
274.1 Is lamina cracking permitted along fibers (type H(elp))?
274.2  
      If this material is isotropic or cloth or has fibers running in
      both directions, answer N.

      If you answer Y, two things will happen in PANDA2:

      1. Cracking due to tension normal to the fiber direction
         will not be treated as failure. Instead, if PANDA2 perceives
         that the allowable stress for tension normal to the fibers
         in a lamina is exceeded, the allowable for compression along
         the fibers in that material at that particular location in
         the laminate will be reduced by half and the allowable for
         in-plane shear will be reduced by 20 per cent.

      2. If during design changes the thickness of any layer made
         of this material becomes less than a quarter of that which
         you give as the minimum thickness (such as .005 in.) the
         layer will disappear.

       If you answer N, even though the material is unidirectional,
       cracking due to tension normal to the fibers will be treated
       as failure, and the layer will never disappear no matter how
       thin it gets during optimization iterations.

276.1 Thickness of a single lamina of matl type
276.2 
      What is wanted here is the tape thickness (for example, .005 in.)
      or cloth thickness. This thickness will be used later to judge
      whether layers less than 25 per cent of the tape thickness should
      be dropped from the laminate during optimization. Also, the
      thickness of a single layer of tape or cloth is needed in order
      to calculate, for the current design,
      how many adjacent unidirectional layers
      are present in each part of the structure.  These data are
      then used to determine the current value of maximum allowable
      stress, which often decreases with increasing thickness of
      "blocks" of unidirectional material.

277.1 Does max. allowable stress decrease for more layers?
277.2 
      As described above, the maximum allowable stresses, sig1(tension),
      sig1(comp.), sig2(tension), sig2(comp.), and sig12, which you
      have just provided, are for a single layer of tape or cloth.
      Tests have shown that these maximum values often degrade when
      there exist in a structure multiple adjacent unidirectional
      layers. If you answer this question N it is assumed that the
      maximum allowable stresses that you just gave hold no matter
      how many adjacent layers of unidirectional material exist any-
      where in your panel. If you answer this question Y you will
      next have the opportunity to provide percentage degradation of
      the maximum allowable stresses with increasing numbers of layers
      of adjacent unidirectional material.

278.0
      Next, you will be asked to indicate for this material type
      how the maximum allowable stresses that you gave above for a
      single layer of tape or cloth, degrade with increasing number
      of multiple adjacent layers of unidirectional material. PANDA2
      will first ask for percentage degradation in each of the
      maximum stress allowables for n = 2 adjacent layers of
      unidirectional material; then percentage degradation in each
      of the maximum stress allowables for n = 3 adjacent layers
      of unidirectional material; then the same for n = 4, n = 5,
      etc., until n = 10 or until you want to stop, whichever comes
      first. The percentage degradation that is wanted is the per-
      centage from the allowables for a single layer.

      Later, during execution, the critical stress margins
      will be calculated taking into account the current thicknesses
      of each unidirectional layer in the laminates, that is, how
      many layers of tape or cloth are required to compose the
      unidirectional layer and what is the corresponding failure
      criterion for that number of adjacent unidirectional layers.

279.1 Degradation (%) in max. sig1(tension) for n layers, n=
279.2 
      A typical value for percentage degradation in the maximum
      allowable tensile stress along the fibers is about 20 per
      cent for two adjacent layers (n=2) with the same angular
      orientation, 30 per cent for n=3, 40 per cent for n=4, etc.
      The percentage degradation that is wanted is that from the
      original values you gave for the single layer of tape or
      cloth.

280.1 Degradation (%) in max. sig1(comp.)   for n layers, n=
280.2 
      A typical value for percentage degradation in the maximum
      allowable compressive stress along the fibers is about 20
      per cent for two adjacent layers (n=2) with the same angular
      orientation, 30 per cent for n=3, 40 per cent for n=4, etc.
      The percentage degradation that is wanted is that from the
      original values you gave for the single layer of tape or
      cloth.

281.1 Degradation (%) in max. sig2(tension) for n layers, n=
281.2 
      A typical value for percentage degradation in the maximum
      allowable tensile stress normal to the fibers is about 20
      per cent for two adjacent layers (n=2) with the same angular
      orientation, 30 per cent for n=3, 40 per cent for n=4, etc.
      The percentage degradation that is wanted is that from the
      original values you gave for the single layer of tape or
      cloth.

282.1 Degradation (%) in max. sig2(comp.)   for n layers, n=
282.2 
      A typical value for percentage degradation in the maximum
      allowable compressive stress normal to the fibers is about 20
      per cent for two adjacent layers (n=2) with the same angular
      orientation, 30 per cent for n=3, 40 per cent for n=4, etc.
      The percentage degradation that is wanted is that from the
      original values you gave for the single layer of tape or
      cloth.

283.1 Degradation (%) in max. sig12         for n layers, n=
283.2 
      A typical value for percentage degradation in the maximum
      allowable shear stress in the plane of the fibers is about 20
      per cent for two adjacent layers (n=2) with the same angular
      orientation, 30 per cent for n=3, 40 per cent for n=4, etc.
      The percentage degradation that is wanted is that from the
      original values you gave for the single layer of tape or
      cloth.

284.1 Any further degradation with more layers of matl type
284.2 
      If you answer N, PANDA2 will assume that there is no further
      degradation in maximum allowable stress with further increase
      in the number of layers of adjacent unidirectional material.

285.0 
      This material has elastic moduli that are much lower than those
      of the other materials used in this structure. Next, you will be
      asked if this material forms the core of a sandwich wall or (if
      this material is associated with an extreme layer) does it act as
      an external elastic foundation. If you answer "N", then PANDA2 will
      treat the layers made of this material as it does any other layers.
      If you answer "Y", then PANDA2 will ask you additional questions,
      the nature of which depends on whether this material represents
      an external elastic foundation or a sandwich core. If this material
      is associated with an extreme "layer", PANDA2 will assume that this
      "layer" represents an elastic foundation and ask for an effective
      elastic foundation modulus, K (e.g. lb/in**3).

      If this material is associated with an internal layer, PANDA2 will
      assume that this layer represents a sandwich core. Two types of
      sandwich core are permitted: 1. foam and 2. honeycomb with regular
      hexagonal cells.

      If the material is foam (NOT honeycomb), then PANDA2 will ask you
      to provide the following quantities:
      ECORE = elastic modulus for deformation of core normal to facesheets
      G13   = elastic shear modulus for axial-normal transverse shearing
      G23   = elastic shear modulus for  hoop-normal transverse shearing
      rhoc  = weight density of core material (e.g. lb/in**3)
      Kglue = effective elastic foundation modulus of the adhesive layer
              between one face sheet and the sandwich core (e.g. lb/in**3)
      Wglue = weight/area of BOTH facesheet-adhesive layers.
      w0/L  = initial waviness ratio for face sheets
      sigmaa= allowable normal stress for the foam core/adhesive combination

      If the material IS honeycomb, then PANDA2 will ask for:
      s     = length of one side of the regular hexagonal cell
      tc    = thickness of the honeycomb cell wall
      Ec    = elastic modulus for stretching of the honeycomb cell wall
              in the direction normal to the plane of the facesheets
      Gc    = elastic modulus for in-plane shearing of honeycomb cell wall
      rhoc  = weight density of honeycomb cell wall material (e.g. lb/in**3)
      kglue = effective facesheet-core integument spring stiffness per
              honeycomb cell wall width [e.g. (lb/in)/in]
      Wglue = weight/area of BOTH facesheet-adhesive layers.
      w0/L  = initial waviness ratio for face sheets
      Fpull = force/length required for honeycomb cell wall pull-out
      "Y"or"N" (facewrinklewavelength)/celldiam constraint to be enforced?

      For either foam core or honeycomb core sandwich walls, PANDA2 also
      asks you to provide "look-up" tables for the following quantities
      as functions of core weight density:

        Sandwich core crushing strength (e.g. psi, Mpa)       
        "L"-direction (x-z) transverse shear strength of core (e.g. psi)
        "W"-direction (y-z) transverse shear strength of core (e.g. psi)
        Modifying factor for honeycomb cell wall pullout

      In the case of honeycomb core sandwich walls, the width of one side
      of the hexagonal cell, "s", and cell wall thickness, "tc", can be
      decision variables.

      In the case of sandwich wall construction, PANDA2 computes local
      buckling of the two sandwich face sheets:
       1. as supported by the elastic core ("face wrinkling"), and
       2. within a single cell of the honeycomb core ("face dimpling"),
          if the material is honeycomb material.

      "Face wrinkling" is computed from three theories: 1. Bushnell and
      2. Vinson and 3. Hoff. Buckling of the sandwich wall as a unit
      (buckle half wavelength at least five wall thicknesses in length,
      e.g. general instability in the case of an unstiffened plate) is
      computed from two theories: 1. Bushnell and 2. Vinson. Face dimpling
      is computed only by Bushnell's theory.

      PANDA2 also computes "core shear crimping", a short-wavelength mode
      in which the sandwich core buckles in transverse shear deformation.
      An equation analogous to Eq. (12), p. 1692 in Vinson's 1986 AIAA J.
      paper is used in PANDA2. Vinson's Eq.(12) is modified to permit
      prediction of "core crimping" under combined in-plane loads, Nx,
      Ny, Nxy.

      Please see ITEM 271 in .../panda2/doc/panda2.news for more details
      and for examples.

286.1 Does this material form the core of a sandwich wall? Matl no. 
286.2 
      If you answer "N", then PANDA2 will treat the layers made of this
      material as it does any other layers. If you answer "Y", then
      PANDA2 will ask you for additional data as just described.

287.1 Does this material act as an external elastic foundation? Matl  no.
287.2
      If you answer "N", then PANDA2 will treat the layers made of this
      material as it does any other layers. If you answer "Y", then
      PANDA2 will ask you for an effective elastic foundation modulus,
      K (e.g. lb/in**3), and compute local buckling of the module
      segment(s) as supported by the elastic foundation with modulus K.
      PANDA2 assumes the elastic foundation is a Winkler foundation.
      NOTE: PANDA2 neglects the weight of the elastic foundation!

288.1 Effective elastic foundation stiffness, K (e.g.lb/in**3)
288.2 
      NOTE: PANDA2 assumes a Winkler elastic foundation.

289.1 Is the sandwich core of honeycomb construction?
289.2 
      If you answer "N" PANDA2 will NOT compute "face dimpling", that
      is, local buckling of the face sheets within a single cell of
      the core material.

290.1 Length of one side of the hexagon, s
290.2
      PANDA2 always assumes that the honeycomb core has cells with
      cross section that forms a regular hexagon with side of length
      s. Within PANDA2 it is assumed that "face dimpling" occurs over
      a square with axial and hoop length 2*s. A regular hexagon
      with side of length s can be inscribed in this square. (In
      fact, a regular hexagon with side of length s can be inscribed
      in a rectangle of length 2*s and width s*SQRT(3). However, in
      order to avoid the necessity of performing at least two dimpling
      analyses in which the orientation of the rectangle is changed
      from long axis parallel to the axial direction to long axis
      parallel to the hoop direction, the width is increased to 2*s).
      Classical simple support condition is assumed along all four
      edges of the superscribed square. This model is expected to provide
      a lower bound for the face dimpling load factor. Vinson (AIAA J.
      1986, pp. 1690-1696) uses  d=1.732*s, the diameter of an inscribed
      circle; PANDA2 uses 2*s, the length of one side of a superscribed
      square. NOTE: "s" is permitted to be a decision variable.

291.1 thickness of honeycomb cell wall, tc
291.2 
      The cell wall thickness, tc, is shown in Fig. 2 of Prof. Jack
      Vinson's paper: "Optimum design of composite honeycomb sandwich
      panels subjected to uniaxial compression", AIAA J., Vol. 24, No.
      10, pp 1690-1696, 1986. tc is used in Eqs. (18) and (19) there.
      NOTE: "tc" is permitted to be a decision variable.

292.1 "Normal" elastic modulus of the honeycomb cell wall, Ec
292.2 
      What is wanted here is the elastic modulus for stretching of the
      honeycomb cell material in the direction normal to the plane of
      the sandwich face sheets. For example, if the honeycomb is made
      of aluminum, Ec would have a value of approximately 10*10**6 psi.
      Ec is the modulus on the right-hand-side of Eq.(19) in Vinson's
      1986 AIAA J. paper (see "help" for prompt for cell wall thickness
      tc for complete reference citation). PANDA2 internally computes
      the effective ("smeared cell") sandwich core modulus, Ecore(eff),
      from the formula:

               Ecore(eff) = (8/3)*(tc/d)*Ec            (Vinson's Eq.(19))

      in which d = 1.732*s, where s is the length of one side of the hex.
      NOTE: Do not include effect of adhesive layers here. That is done
      later. (See "help" for kglue).

293.1 "Normal" elastic modulus of the sandwich core, Ec
293.2 
      What is wanted here is the effective elastic modulus for stretching
      of the sandwich core material in the direction normal to the plane
      of the sandwich face sheets.

294.1 elastic shear modulus of the honeycomb cell wall, Gc
294.2 
      What is wanted here is the elastic shear modulus for in-plane
      shearing of a honeycomb cell wall material. For example, if the
      honeycomb is made of aluminum, Gc would have a value of about
      3.8*10**6 psi. Gc is the modulus on the right-hand-sides of
      Eqs.(18b,c) in Vinson's 1986 AIAA J. paper (see "help" for prompt
      for cell wall thickness tc for complete reference citation).
      PANDA2 internally computes two effective ("smeared cell")
      transverse shear elastic moduli from the formulas:

                 G13 = (4/3)*(tc/d)*Gc              (Vinson's Eq.(18b)
                 G23 =(8/15)*(tc/d)*Gc              (Vinson's Eq.(18c)

      in which d = 1.732*s, where s is the length of one side of the hex.
      NOTE: These formulas are based on the assumption that the honeycomb
      core, as depicted in Fig. (2) of Vinson's 1986 AIAA J. paper, is
      oriented in the panel as if the horizontal axis in Vinson's Fig. (2)
      is aligned with the axial coordinate, x, in the panel module segment.
      (Stringers run parallel to x; the axial load Nx is parallel to x).
      PANDA2 does not permit the honeycomb core to be oriented in any other
      way.

295.1 "x-z" elastic shear modulus of the sandwich core, Gcx
295.2 
      What is wanted here is the effective elastic shear modulus for
      the sandwich core for shearing in the axial-normal (x-z) plane.
      Gcx is the modulus on the left-hand-side of Eqs.(18b) in Vinson's
      1986 AIAA J. paper. (AIAA J., 1986, pp 1690-1696)

296.1 "y-z" elastic shear modulus of the sandwich core, Gcy
296.2 
      What is wanted here is the effective elastic shear modulus for
      the sandwich core for shearing in the hoop-normal (y-z) plane.
      Gcy is the modulus on the left-hand-side of Eqs.(18c) in Vinson's
      1986 AIAA J. paper. (AIAA J., 1986, pp 1690-1696)

297.1 weight density of the honeycomb core cell wall material, rhoc
297.2 
      What is wanted here is the effective weight density (e.g. lb/in**3)
      of the cell wall of the honeycomb sandwich core. For example,
      if the honeycomb is made of aluminum, rhoc would have a value of
      about 0.1 lb/in**3. rhoc is the density on the right-hand-side of
      Eq. (18a) in Vinson's 1986 AIAA J. paper (see "help" for prompt
      for cell wall thickness tc for complete reference citation).
      Do not include the weight of the facesheet-to-core glue for this
      input. That is asked for later (see Wglue). The effective ("smeared
      cell") weigh density of the honeycomb part of the core (excluding
      glue) is computed by PANDA2 internally from the formula
             rho(effective) = (8/3)*(tc/d)*rhoc       (Vinson Eq.(18a)
      in which d = 1.732*s, where s is the length of one side of the hex.
      (NOTE: See the "help" paragraph for Wglue for the total effective
      weight density of the sandwich core, including glue).
      (ANOTHER NOTE: For aluminum you will have to use a weight density
      somewhat greater than 0.1 lb/in**3 in order to account for the fact
      that when the honeycomb material is fabricated, there is extra
      weight due to adhesive used to assemble honeycomb cells from layers
      of corrugated sheet. (See Hexcel Corp. catalogue TSB 120, "Mechanical
      properties of honeycomb material"). Same goes for any other material.

298.1 weight density of the sandwich core material, rhoc
298.2 
      What is wanted here is the effective weight density (e.g. lb/in**3)
      of the sandwich core material. rhoc is the density on the
      left-hand-side of Eq. (18a) in Vinson's 1986 AIAA J. paper
      (see "help" for prompt for cell wall thickness tc for complete
      reference citation). Do not include the weight of the facesheet-
      core glue layer for this input. That is asked for later (see
      "help" for Wglue).

299.1 Facesheet-core glue stiffness/length [e.g.(lb/in)/in], kglue
299.2 
      The honeycomb sandwich core is glued to each face sheet. It is
      assumed that the glue sticks to the facesheet and to the sides of
      the honeycomb cells in the neighborhood of the facesheet. This
      glue integument can be thought of as a sort of T-shaped spring
      that binds the facesheet to the honeycomb core cell wall. What is
      wanted for kglue is the effective "glue-spring" stiffness (e.g.
      lb/in) per honeycomb cell wall edge width for ONE facesheet-core
      interface. "kglue" (with a lower-case k) is used to compute an
      effective elastic foundation modulus Kglue (capital K; e.g.
      lb/in**3) for the ONE facesheet-core interface. The effective
      glue-"layer" elastic foundation modulus, Kglue, is expressed
      in terms of the input data, kglue and "s", by the formula:

               Kglue = 2*kglue/[SQRT(3)*s]

      in which "s" is the dimension of one side of the regular hexagon.
      "s" can be a decision variable. Hence, as "s" changes during
      optimization cycles, so does the effective foundation modulus
      Kglue of the glue "layer" between one face sheet and the sandwich
      core. (Bigger hex cells mean a weaker effective glue foundation
      modulus.) PANDA2 assumes that both glue "layers" (one glue "layer"
      between each face sheet and the sandwich core) have the same
      effective elastic foundation modulus, Kglue. The overall effective
      elastic foundation modulus of the sandwich core is then given by

                K(effective) = 1/(1/Kglue + 1/Kcore)

      in which the elastic foundation modulus of the sandwich core,
      Kcore, is assumed by PANDA2 to be

                Kcore = Ecore(eff)/(0.5*Hcore)

      where Ecore(eff) is the elastic modulus of the sandwich core for
      displacements normal to the face sheets and Hcore is the thickness
      of the sandwich core. If you want to neglect the effect of the
      glue layers, just set kglue equal to a number that is very large
      compared to a typical material stiffness. (If you accidentally
      set kglue = 0., thinking that this makes PANDA2 ignore the effect
      of glue stiffness, PANDA2 will change kglue to 10*10**16, so that
      you will be correct in your thinking!)
      
300.1 Effective foundation modulus for adhesive layer, Kglue
300.2 
      The sandwich core is glued to each face sheet. (There are a
      total of two glue layers in each sandwich wall. See Fig. 1, p. 155
      of "Computational models for sandwich panels and shells", by
      Noor, Burton, and Bert, Appl Mech Rev, Vol.49, March 1996). What
      is wanted here is the effective elastic foundation modulus, Kglue
      (e.g. lb/in**3), for ONE glue layer. PANDA2 assumes that both
      glue layers (one glue layer between each face sheet and the core)
      have the same effective elastic foundation modulus, Kglue. The
      overall effective elastic foundation modulus of the sandwich core
      is then given by

                K(effective) = 1/(1/Kglue + 1/Kcore)

      in which the elastic foundation modulus of the sandwich core,
      Kcore, is assumed by PANDA2 to be

                Kcore = Ecore(eff)/(0.5*Hcore)

      where Ecore(eff) is the elastic modulus of the sandwich core for
      displacements normal to the face sheets and Hcore is the thickness
      of the sandwich core. If you want to neglect the effect of the
      glue layers, just set Kglue equal to a number that is very large
      compared to a typical material stiffness. (If you accidentally
      set Kglue = 0., thinking that this makes PANDA2 ignore the effect
      of glue stiffness, PANDA2 will change Kglue to 10*10**16, so that
      you will be correct in your thinking!)

301.1 Weight/area of ALL glue used with this core mat'l, Wglue
301.2 
      What is wanted here is the Weight/area of BOTH of the two
      glue "layers" that form the interfaces between the two face
      sheets and the core (e.g. lb/in**2: NOT density!). PANDA2 will
      compute an effective weight density (e.g. lb/in**3) of the
      sandwich core material from the formula:

          DENSITY(effective) = (rho(eff)*Hcore + Wglue)/Hcore

      in which rho(eff) is the effective ("smeared cell") density of
      the honeycomb part of the sandwich core (or foam part of the core
      if the core is not honeycomb construction).
      If you want to neglect the weight of the glue, set Wglue = 0.
      NOTE FOR HONEYCOMB CORES: It is assumed that the weight of
      the glue does not depend on the size ("s") of the honeycomb cells.

302.1 Initial waviness ratio for face sheets, w0/L
302.2 
      According to Plantema in his book, SANDWICH CONSTRUCTIONS (John
      Wiley, 1996), a typical value of w0/L for panels of good quality
      is 0.001, where w0 is the amplitude of the face sheet initial
      waviness and L is the halfwavelength of the face wrinkling mode
      of instability. Eqs.(3) on p. 43 of Plantema's book give the
      normal and shear stress in the sandwich core at the facesheet-
      core interface as:

              sigma = pi*(w0/L)*SQRT(Gcore*Ecore)/(lambda-1)
                tau = pi*(w0/L)*Gcore/(lambda-1)

      in which the halfwavelength L of the face wrinkling buckling mode
      is given by:

                  L = 1.26*pi*[C44(face)**2/(Gcore*Ecore)]**(1/6)

      where Gcore = x-z core transverse shear modulus; Ecore is the
      effective core modulus for normal deformation w; lambda is the
      load factor (greater than unity) for face wrinkling; and C44(face)
      is the axial bending stiffness of the face sheet. These formulas
      presume uniaxial loading (loading in the x-direction) and an
      isotropic core.

303.1 Force/length required for honeycomb cell wall pull-out, FPULL
303.2 
      A typical number might be about 50 lb/in, for example. FPULL would
      be obtained from a test such as follows:

          ____facesheet
         /
        /
       /
      ||// <---adhesive
      ||//
      ||//
      ||///
      ||////
      ||///////
      ||/////////////////////////////// <--adhesive
      ||------------------------------------ honeycomb cell wall-->FPULL
      ||/////////////////////////////// <--adhesive
      ||///////
      ||////
      ||///
      ||//
      ||//
      ||// <---adhesive

      The FPULL from such a test would be twice the value of what is
      called "FILLET LOAD" in the Hexcel Corp. report, "Aluminum
      Honeycomb Flatwise Tensile Strengths", by Tom N. Bitzer, Hexcel
      report no. LSR 932480, January 15, 1933, Hexcel Corp., 11711
      Dublin Blvd., Dublin, CA 94568.

      From the quantity FPULL, PANDA2 computes an allowable normal
      tensile stress for the adhesive from the formula:

       sigma(adhesive normal allowable) = 2*FPULL*MODIFY/(1.732*s)

      in which MODIFY is a user-provided factor that depends on the
      honeycomb core density and "s" is the length of one side of
      the regular hexagonal honeycomb cell. The "lookup" table that
      contains MODIFY as a function of core density must be supplied
      by you later.

304.1 Allowable normal stress for the foam core/adhesive combination
304.2 
      What is meant here is allowable normal TENSILE stress.
      PANDA2 computes the maximum normal stress in the foam core
      and constructs a constraint of the type:

      (max. normal stress constraint) =
           (allowable normal stress)/[(computed normal stress)*(f.s.)]
      
      in which "f.s." means "factor of safety".

305.1 Ultimate tension stress in honeycomb cell wall material
305.2
      Tension failure may occur either of the facesheet-core bond or
      of the honeycomb cell wall material. Please see the Hexcel Corp.
      report: "Aluminum Honeycomb Flatwise Tensile Strengths", by Tom
      N. Bitzer, Hexcel report no. LSR 932480, January 15, 1933,
      Hexcel Corp., 11711 Dublin Blvd., Dublin, CA 94568. The facesheet-
      core bond failure is covered by FPULL and MODIFY. Here the
      ultimate tension stress allowable for the honeycomb cell wall
      is wanted. According to Bitzer's report, typical minimum numbers
      for aluminum are:

        42 ksi for 5052-H191;  58 ksi for 5056-H191; 48 ksi for 2024-T3.

306.1 (facewrinklewavelength)/celldiam constraint to be enforced?
306.2 
      Recommendation: try "N" first, then "Y" and see if there is
      a significant weight penalty incurred for optimum designs. If
      the weight penalty is not significant with a "Y" answer, then
      use "Y". If there is a significant weight penalty with use of
      "Y", then use "N" but be extra careful to check PANDA2's optimum
      designs by using other analyses, your intuition and your
      engineering experience. The honeycomb cells might get too large.

      With a "Y" answer PANDA2 sets up a constraint for each sandwich
      face sheet which forces the halfwavelength of the face wrinkling
      instability mode to be greater than twice the flat-to-flat
      diameter, d=1.732*s, of the hexagonal honeycomb cell, that is:

            (face wrinkling halfwavelength)/(1.732*s) > 2.0

      in which "s" is the width of one side of the regular hexagon.

      With the "(facewrinklewavelength)/celldiam" constraint turned
      on, PANDA2 generates two margins for each panel module segment
      that has sandwich wall construction with honeycomb core. These
      two margins have the form:

      Face1 wavelength/celldiam;STR;Iseg=1 ;Matl=2 ;MIDLENGTH;FS=1.      
      Face2 wavelength/celldiam;STR;Iseg=1 ;Matl=2 ;MIDLENGTH;FS=1.      

      in which, of course, "STR" could be "RNG", Iseg can be any
      panel module segment number, Matl can be any material number,
      and "MIDLENGTH" could be "AT RINGS" or "PANEL END".

      The "(facewrinklewavelength)/celldiam" constraint forces the
      honeycomb core into a "small cell" configuration which renders
      valid the Plantema equations for facesheet-core interface stresses
      of a sandwich panel with initially wavy face sheets and the Hetenyi
      equations for the "beam-on-elastic-foundation deformations caused
      by line forces or moments applied by deformed, imperfect stringer
      webs to face sheets of adjacent sandwich segments. For more
      details, see ITEMs 271 and 477 in the panda2.news file.

308.0 
      You are designing and/or analyzing a beam. You will be asked
      to provide the following loads on the beam, all of which are
      considered to be in Load Set A (eigenvalue parameters):

       P is the total axial load, negative for axial compression
         (units are lbs, for example). P is analogous to Nx in
         "ordinary" panel analysis with PANDA2. (Nx = P/b, where
         b is the width of the lower flange). P acts on the beam
         at the neutral plane for axial bending: P causes no axial
         bending if the beam is perfectly straight.

       M is the total moment about an axis normal to the beam
         axis and parallel to the planes of the lower and upper
         flanges of the beam (the lower flange of the beam is
         analogous to the panel skin in "ordinary" panel analysis
         with PANDA2). (units are in-lbs, for example). M is
         analogous to Mx in "ordinary" panel analysis with PANDA2.
         (Mx = M/b, where b is the width of the lower flange).

       W is the lateral load on the beam in (force/length). W acts
         on the lower flange of the beam and acts normal to this
         flange. (units are lbs/in, for example). W is analogous
         to pressure p in "ordinary" panel analysis with PANDA2.
         (p=W/b, where b is the width of the lower flange).

309.1 Axial load P (negative for compression), P

       P is the total axial load, negative for axial compression
         (units are lbs, for example). P is analogous to Nx in
         "ordinary" panel analysis with PANDA2. (Nx = P/b, where
         b is the with of the lower flange). P acts on the beam
         at the neutral plane for axial bending: P causes no axial
         bending if the beam is perfectly straight.

310.1 Moment M (positive M compresses lower flange), M
310.2 
       M is the total moment about an axis normal to the beam axis
         and parallel to the planes of the lower and upper flanges
         of the beam (units are in-lbs, for example). M is analogous
         to Mx in "ordinary" panel analysis with PANDA2. (Mx = M/b,
         where b is the width of the lower flange). Positive M
         compresses the lower flange of the beam. (The "upper" flange
         is analogous to the "outstanding" flange of a stringer
         attached to a panel skin and the "lower" flange is analogous
         to the panel skin in an "ordinary" PANDA2 analysis of a
         stringer stiffened panel).

311.1 Lateral load W (type H(elp) for sign convention), W
311.2 
       W is the lateral load on the beam in (force/length). W acts
         on the lower flange of the beam and acts normal to this
         flange. (units are lbs/in, for example). W is analogous
         to pressure p in "ordinary" panel analysis with PANDA2.
         (p=W/b, where b is the width of the lower flange).
         Positive W causes bending of the beam so that the lower
         flange of the beam is axially compressed more than the
         upper flange of the beam. (The "upper" flange is analogous
         to the "outstanding" flange of a stringer attached to a
         panel skin and the "lower" flange is analogous to the
         panel skin in an "ordinary" PANDA2 analysis of a stringer
         stiffened panel).

      Next, provide applied resultants, (Nx,Ny,Nxy,Mx,My) and
      (Nx0,Ny0), which are considered to be applied to the panel
      edges. These are stress resultants in units, for example, of
      lb/in for the in-plane loads Nx,Ny,Nxy and (in-lb)/in for the
      moment resultants Mx,My:

         (Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My) constitute part of Load Set A
                               (eigenvalue loads); 
         (Nx0, Ny0   ) are part of Load Set B (fixed and uniform
                       loads). 

      In the absence of normal pressure, the loads corresponding
      to general instability bifurcation buckling are given by: 

         Nx(crit) = Nx0(T) +Nx0 + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nx
         Ny(crit) = Ny0(T) +Ny0 + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Ny
         Nxy(crit) =              eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nxy
         Mx(crit) =               eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Mx 
         My(crit) =               eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*My

      in which Nx0(T) and Ny0(T) are the stress resultants from
      curing and temperature loading (considered in this example
      to be part of Load Set B; it is permitted to have them in
      Load Set A, however).

      Also, provide uniform normal pressure, p.  The pressure p
      can be considered either as part of Load Set A or as part
      of Load Set B. If the pressure is part of Load set B, the
      loads corresponding to bifurcation buckling are given by: 

       Nx(crit) = Nx0(T)+Nx0+Nx0(p) + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nx
       Ny(crit) = Ny0(T)+Ny0+Ny0(p) + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Ny
       Nxy(crit) =                    eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nxy.
       Mx(crit) =                     eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Mx 
       My(crit) =                     eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*My
 
      in which Nx0(p) and Ny0(p) are stress resultants induced by
      the normal pressure. (considered in this example to be part of
      Load Set B; it is permitted to put the pressure in Load Set A,
      however).

      You are allowed to provide up to 5 sets of loads, imperfections,
      and factors of safety, that is, up to 5 sets of [Nx, Ny, Nxy,
      Mx, My, Nx0, Ny0, p, Wimp(global), Wimp(local), FSGEN, FSPAN,
      FSLOC, FSBSTR, FSSTR and temperature distributions].

      PANDA2 will generate buckling and
      stress or strain constraints corresponding to each of the
      load and imperfection sets that you provide. The resulting design
      will be the best that PANDA2 can find that is subjected during
      its mission to all of the load sets. If the panel is clamped in
      the prebuckling phase, and if there is applied pressure p, then
      those load sets with non-zero p will each have two subcases,
      the first corresponding to conditions at the midlength of the
      panel and the second to conditions at the panel ends. Two subcases
      are also run for cylindrical panels with rings: Subcase 1 corres-
      ponds to conditions midway between adjacent rings and Subcase 2
      corresponds to conditions at the rings.

      For each load set (Nx, Ny, Nxy,....) you will have to provide
      five "factors of safety", FSGEN, FSPAN, FSLOC, FSBSTR and FSSTR. 
     
      FSGEN pertains to general instability (buckling modes which
      include both rings and stringers); FSPAN pertains to panel
      instability (buckling modes for which the rings rotate only
      and for which the stringers deflect; FSLOC pertains to local
      instability between adjacent rings and stringers; FSBSTR
      pertains to local buckling of stringer parts.  FSLOC and
      FSBSTR play  special roles, so read this carefully!  FSSTR is
      the factor of safety for stress.

      FSGEN and FSPAN should always be greater than or equal
      to unity. The purpose of these two factors is to compensate for
      initial imperfections and to prevent general instability or
      panel instability (general buckling between rings). 
      The values you assign these factors depend on the geometry and
      loading.  There is a huge literature on the difficult subject
      of "imperfection sensitivity". A recent survey is contained in
      the book, COMPUTERIZED BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF SHELLS by David
      Bushnell, published by Nijhoff and Co., The Netherlands in 1985.
      If you assign a factor of 1.0 to FSGEN and/or FSPAN, the factor
      will automatically be changed by PANDA2 to 1.1 in order to avoid
      the nearly singular behavior that occurs near general or panel
      buckling (abrupt increase in bowing amplitude). This singular
      behavior causes difficulties in convergence of the design
      during optimization iterations.

      Note: During 1993-1994 PANDA2 was upgraded to allow the user
      to supply amplitudes of the following kinds of initial geometric
      imperfections in unstiffened and stiffened cylindrical panels
      and shells:

           1. Out-of-roundness
           2. General buckling modal imperfection (imperfection has
              the shape of the critical general buckling mode).
           3. Inter-ring buckling modal imperfection (imperfection has
              the shape of the critical bay buckling mode from a model
              in which the stringers are smeared out and the panel
              is simply supported at adjacent rings).
           4. Local buckling modal imperfection (imperfection has the
              shape of the critical local skin buckling mode from a model
              in which the local piece of skin is simply supported at
              adjacent stringers and rings).

      If the user supplies reasonable amplitudes for these types of
      imperfections, then he/she may use factors of safety FSGEN and
      FSPAN of unity, provided that the load corresponds to ULTIMATE
      load, not operating load.

      FSLOC plays a special role. If you do not want local buckling
      of the panel skin to occur (you don't want any postbuckling
      capability of the panel skin), then set FSLOC greater than unity,
      as with FSGEN and FSPAN. With IQUICK = 0, if you set FSLOC = 1.0,
      PANDA2 will automatically increase it to 1.1.
      
      IF YOU WANT SKIN POSTBUCKLING CAPABILITY, BUT YOU DO NOT WANT LOCAL
      BUCKLING TO OCCUR AT LESS THAN A CERTAIN FRACTION OF THE APPLIED
      LOAD, THEN SET  FSLOC  EQUAL TO THAT FRACTION OF THE LOAD.
      IF YOU DON'T CARE AT WHAT LOAD LOCAL BUCKLING OCCURS, SET FSLOC
      EQUAL TO ZERO. PANDA2 WILL THEN ALLOW THE PANEL TO BUCKLE LOCALLY,
      AND IF IQUICK = 0 WILL INCLUDE POST-LOCAL-BUCKLING PHENOMENA IN
      CALCULATIONS OF GENERAL AND PANEL INSTABILITY AND STRESS.

      The comments for FSLOC apply to the buckling factors of safety
      for stringer parts FSBSTR, also. You probably will usually set
      FSBSTR equal to unity.

      IF YOU PLAN TO USE A VALUE OF FSBSTR THAT IS LESS THAN UNITY,
      MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ CAREFULLY ITEMS 37, 60(c), AND 67
      IN PANDA2.NEWS.

      There is no capability to handle local postbuckling of ring parts.
      PANDA2 assigns factors of safety to buckling of ring parts; You
      have no control over them.

      Now, please provide the first Load Set A (Nx, Ny, Nxy)...
  
313.0 
      You will next be asked to provide loads for Load Set A
      (Nx, Ny, Nxy, p) followed by loads for Load Set B (Nx0, Ny0, p0)
      for the STAGS finite element model.

      Now provide loads (Nx, Ny, Nxy, p) for Load Set A.

314.1 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) normal to the plane of screen, Nx
314.2 
      What is wanted is the applied line load in the L1 (axial)
      direction in units of force/length. Negative for compression.
      If this axial load varies in the L2 (circumferential) direction,
      use the largest compressive value applied to that edge of the
      panel.

      What is wanted now is the axial load in Load Set A, that is
      the eigenvalue load: the load to be multiplied by the critical
      load factor (the eigenvalue) in computations of the critical
      applied load.

315.1 Do you really want axial tension (Y or N)?
316.1 Do you really want tensile Nx in Load Set A ?
316.2 
      It is better to include tensile loads as part of Load Set B,
      that is, loads that are not multiplied by eigenvalues. It leads
      to less chance that PANDA2 will bomb while searching for
      eigenvalues that may not exist, and cases will require less
      computer time with tensile loads included as part of Load Set B.

      YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED TO INCLUDE TENSILE LOADS AS PART OF
      LOAD SET B.

317.1 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) in the plane of the screen,    Ny
317.2 
      What is wanted is the applied resultant, Ny, in the L2  (circum-
      ferential) direction  (units of force/length).  Negative for
      compression.  This circumferential load is assumed to be
      uniform over the entire panel.

      Again, what is wanted here is the Load Set A (eigenvalue
      parameter) circumferential stress resultant, Ny.

      NOTE: If the panel is curved the value of Ny must be consistent
            with the pressure in Load Set A, and the pressure (to be
            provided by you later) must be consistent with the value
            of Ny that you apply now. (For cylindrical panels Ny=p*r).

318.1 Do you really want hoop tension (Y or N)?
319.1 Do you really want tensile Ny in Load Set A ?
319.2 
      It is better to include tensile loads as part of Load Set B,
      that is, loads that are not multiplied by eigenvalues. It leads
      to less chance that PANDA2 will bomb while searching for
      eigenvalues that may not exist, and cases will require less
      computer time with tensile loads included as part of Load Set B.

      YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED TO INCLUDE TENSILE LOADS AS PART OF
      LOAD SET B.

320.1 In-plane shear in load set A,                  Nxy
320.2 
      Positive sense is shown in Fig. 11 of the long PANDA2 paper,
      "PANDA2 - program for minimum weight design of stiffened,..."
      Computers and Structures, vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605, 1987.
      Units are force/length.  The in-plane shear is assumed to be
      uniform over the entire panel. Note that for composite laminated
      panels buckling load factors are different for positive and
      negative Nxy, sometimes dramatically different.

      Please note that no fixed in-plane shear component is permitted
      (Nxy0 = 0.)

322.1 Does the axial load vary in the L2 direction?
322.2 
      The L2 direction is in the plane of the screen (circum-
      ferential). If you answer  Y  you will next be asked to
      provide values of Nx at the beginning and end of the panel
      edge which lies in the plane of the screen. PANDA2 assumes
      that Nx varies linearly across this edge and is uniform in
      the direction normal to the plane of the screen.

      NOTE: It may in some cases be beneficial to answer this
            question Y and then provide the same Nx at the beginning
            and end of the axially loaded edge, thus providing
            a uniform axial load. Please see ITEM No.   in PANDA2.NEWS
            and read the "handout" entitled "BUCKLING OF UNSTIFFENED
            PERFECT AND IMPERFECT UNSTIFFENED CYLINDRICAL SHELLS WITH
            PANDA2, dated 25 November, 1988.

      If you answer N the axial load will be uniform over the
      entire panel.

323.1 Value of Nx at beginning of panel edge, NXBEG
323.2 
      The edge referred to is the one that lies in the plane of
      the screen. We are dealing with the axial load (units of
      force/length) here. Negative for compression.

324.1 Value of Nx at    end    of panel edge, NXEND
324.2 
      The edge referred to is the one that lies in the plane of
      the screen. We are dealing with the axial load (units of
      force/length) here. Negative for compression.

326.1 Applied axial moment resultant (e.g. in-lb/in), Mx
326.2 
      This is the moment/(circ. arc) applied to the same edge as the
      axial resultant, Nx. Positive Mx compresses the panel skin
      more than the stringer tip (causes the panel to become curved
      in the axial direction such that the skin is concave as viewed
      from below (see Section 7.2, "Sign conventions..." on pp 492
      and 493 of the long Computers and Structures PANDA2 paper.)

      Mx can be in Load set A ("eigenvalue" loads) only.  Set Mx = 0
      if the panel is clamped in the prebuckling phase of behavior.

328.1 Applied hoop moment resultant (e.g. in-lb/in), My
328.2 
      This is the moment/(axial length) applied to the same edge as the
      hoop resultant, Ny. Positive My compresses the bottom of the panel
      skin more than the top of the skin. (causes the panel to become
      curved in the hoop direction such that the skin is concave as
      viewed from below (see Section 7.2, "Sign conventions..." on pp
      492 and 493 of the long Computers and Structures PANDA2 paper.)

      My can be in Load set A ("eigenvalue" loads) only.  Set My = 0
      if the panel is clamped in the prebuckling phase of behavior.

329.0 
      Next, provide loads for Load Set B (Nx0, Ny0, p0) in the
      STAGS finite element model.

330.0 
      Next, please provide the fixed stress resultants, Nx0 and Ny0.
      These constitute part of the in-plane loads in Load Set B.
      Note that no fixed in-plane shear resultant, Nxy0, is permitted.
      The fixed stress resultants, Nx0 and Ny0, are not multiplied by
      the eigenvalue (eigenvalue = load factor determined in
      bifurcation buckling analyses). In the absence of normal pressure,
      the critical load can be calculated from:

          Nx(crit) = Nx0(T) +Nx0 + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nx
          Ny(crit) = Ny0(T) +Ny0 + eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Ny
         Nxy(crit) =               eigenvalue*Factor-of-safety*Nxy
 
      in which Nx0(T) and Ny0(T) are resultants generated by curing
      and/or temperature (loading) variation from segment to segment
      (considered in the above equations to be part of Load Set B;
      the thermal loading can be part of Load Set A, however).
      Note that the fixed loads are added to any stress resultants
      that are generated by thermal loading of a composite panel. The
      loads that you are now asked to provide are fixed applied loads. 
      
332.1 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) normal to the plane of screen, Nx0
332.2 
      Same sign convention as for Nx: positive for tension. This
      is a Load Set B quantity.

333.1 Resultant (e.g. lb/in) in the plane of the screen,    Ny0
333.2 
      Same sign convention as for Ny: positive for tension. This
      is a Load Set B quantity.

      NOTE: If the panel is curved the value of Ny0 must be consistent
            with the pressure in Load Set B, and the pressure (to be
            provided by you later) must be consistent with the value
            of Ny0 that you apply now. (For cylindrical panels Ny=p*r).

334.1 Axial load applied along the (0=neutral plane), (1=panel skin)
334.2 
      Choose 0 or 1.   

      0   means that the axial load is applied at the neutral surface,
          that is, the axial load causes no axial bending of a panel
          with axial stiffeners. The writer almost always uses this
          choice.

      1   means that the axial load is applied along the middle
          surface of the panel skin.  A simply supported panel
          with axial stiffeners will bend when loaded in this way.
          PANDA2 includes this axial bending (bowing) effect.

      Please use 0 if the panel is clamped. Generally, use 0

335.1 Uniform applied pressure [positive upward. See H(elp)], po
335.2 
      Positive pressure always pushes upward.  (Please refer to the
      sketches of the panel module for physical picture of what "upward" 
      means.)  See Fig. 8, p. 490 of Computers and Structures, Vol. 25,
      1987. If there are no stringers or if you specified that
      the stringers are external, and  if the panel is curved,
      then positive (upward) pressure pushes on the concave surface
      of the panel (is internal). If you specified that the stringers
      are internal and if the panel is curved, then positive (upward)
      pressure pushes on the convex surface of the panel. Figure
      8 of the PANDA2 paper shows the sign convention for pressure
      and curvature.

336.1 Uniform applied pressure [positive upward. See H(elp)], p
336.2 
      NOTE: This pressure is assumed UNIFORM over entire panel.
      Positive pressure always pushes upward.  (Please refer to the
      sketches of the panel module for physical picture of what "upward" 
      means.)  See Fig. 8, p. 490 of Computers and Structures, Vol. 25,
      1987. If there are no stringers or if you specified that
      the stringers are external, and  if the panel is curved,
      then positive (upward) pressure pushes on the concave surface
      of the panel (is internal). If you specified that the stringers
      are internal and if the panel is curved, then positive (upward)
      pressure pushes on the convex surface of the panel. Figure
      8 of the PANDA2 paper shows the sign convention for pressure
      and curvature.

      NOTE: If the panel is curved the value of p must be consistent
            with the value of hoop resultant that you supplied 
            earlier (for cylindrical panels Ny=p*r).

337.1 Is the pressure part of Load Set A?
337.2 
      Load Set A is the "eigenvalue" load set, that is:

        Critical load = (Load Set B) + eigenvalue*(Load Set A)

      If you are concerned with a cylindrical panel or shell and the
      pressure is internal (causes tensile membrane loads), then you
      should probably put the pressure in Load Set B. If the pressure
      is external (causes destabilizing membrane loads), then you
      should probably put the pressure in Load Set A.

      If the structure is a TRUSS-CORE sandwich construction, make the
      pressure part of Load Set A.

338.1 Is the pressure hydrostatic (Type H for "HELP")?
338.2 
      Answer Y if you want PANDA2 to print warning about including
      the contribution of the pressure to the axial load,
                  Nx = p*r/2  or   Nxo = p*r/2

339.1 Choose in-plane immovable (IFREE=0) or movable (IFREE=1) b.c.
339.2 
      The static response to normal pressure may be strongly dependent
      on whether the edges of the panel are allowed to move in the
      horizontal direction (in-plane for flat panel), normal to each edge. 
      IFREE=0 means that this horizontal motion is not allowed. (immovable)
      IFREE=1 means that this horizontal motion is allowed.     (  movable)

      Generally, you will get larger normal deflections (more bowing)
      due to pressure if the edges are movable (IFREE=1). The
      membrane strains will be lower and the bending strains will
      be higher with movable edges than with immovable edges.

      Note that the analysis with IFREE=0 is more rigorous than with
      IFREE = 1: With IFREE=0 Newton iterations converge to a nonlinear
      solution. The assumed displacements, u,v,w appear as Eqs. (9.5)
      in the long PANDA2 paper (Computers and Structures,pp469-605,1987).
      With IFREE=1 the same displacement functions are used, but only
      the linear theory is used, and the in-plane resultants Nx(p), Ny(p)
      are assumed to be zero for a flat panel. (For a curved panel,
      Nx(p) is zero and Ny(p) is calculated from the condition that
      no horizontal force develops along the straight edges).

      Please note that if IFREE = 1, movable edges are permitted only
      in the global model of the entire panel under uniform normal
      pressure unless you specify otherwise. The IFREE=0 condition is
      applied in the local model (single module model) unless you
      specify otherwise in the following prompt.

      If IFREE = 1, any overall axial resultant that develops from
      pressure being applied to the local model is automatically
      cancelled by PANDA2's application of an equal and opposite
      axial resultant, thus maintaining the condition that no
      axial load develops if the edges are free to approach eachother
      as the pressure is applied.

      If you are in doubt, please just hit "ENTER". Then PANDA2
      will supply the default value, which is unity.

340.1 Are you feeling well today (type H)?
340.2 
      This question used to read:
         Local model: Are the edges in-plane movable? [See (H)elp]
      See ITEM 156 of PANDA2.NEWS for the reason it was modified. A
      silly question was added so that people with old cases already
      set up would not run into problems upon re-running these cases.

      This was the old "help" paragraph corresponding to the original
      question:
      Answer Y or N. If you answer Y the response of the local
      (single-module) model to uniform normal pressure is calculated
      from a nonlinear theory in which the two edges normal to the
      screen located at the symmetry planes midway between stringers
      are allowed to approach eachother as the panel skin deforms
      locally under the uniform normal pressure (no in-plane hoop
      load develops in the panel skin as it deforms under the pressure).
      Generally designs obtained with in-plane movable edges are more
      conservative than those obtained with in-plane fixed edges because:

      (a) the maximum stresses are higher with in-plane movable
          edges because there is more bending in this case;

      (b) No in-plane tension develops in the panel skin with in-
          plane movable edges which means that local buckling
          load factors will be lower in this case.

341.1 Is there a maximum allowable deflection due to pressure?
341.2 
      Answer Y or N.  If your answer is Y, then you will be asked
      to provide the maximum deflection allowed. A constraint
      condition will be introduced into the design process. This
      constraint condition has the form:
        
                  WPGMAX/(WPG*AMPLIT) > 1

      in which WPGMAX is the maximum allowable deflection, WPG is
      the normal deflection at the midlength of the panel due to
      pressure without any effect of in-plane applied loads, and
      AMPLIT is an amplitude factor that accounts for the softening
      effect of the in-plane loads. WPG means "normal deflection
      W due to pressure P from a Global (smeared stiffener) model."

342.1 Maximum allowable deflection due to pressure, WPGMAX
342.2 
      This is the maximum normal deflection at the midlength of the
      panel.  In PANDA2 the smeared stiffener model is used to
      predict the normal deflection due to pressure, and this
      deflection, multiplied by an amplitude factor that accounts
      for the softening effect of in-plane applied loads, is
      compared to WPGMAX to generate a constraint condition for the
      optimization analysis.

343.0 
      Your panel is FLAT (not CYLINDRICAL). Therefore you will next
      be asked to provide amplitudes for the following modes of
      initial geometric imperfections (Wimpg, Wloc):

          (a) initial overall bowing imperfection amplitude, Wimpg

               NOTE: If the panel is stiffened, the sign of the
               initial overall bowing imperfection Wimpg is important
               because it affects how the panel skin and stiffener
               cross sections of the initially bent panel become
               loaded under the applied loads. Type H(elp) for a
               discussion of this when you are prompted for Wimpg.

          (b) local buckling modal imperfection amplitude, Wloc

               The sign of Wloc is NOT significant. The local
               imperfection is assumed to have the same shape
               as the local buckling mode of the panel.

344.0 
      You will next be asked to provide amplitudes for the following
      modes of initial geometric imperfections
                    (Wimpg1, Wimpg2, Wpan, Wloc):

      (a) overall out-of-roundness amplitude, Wimpg1, where
              Wimpg1 = (Max. diameter - Min. diameter)/4.

           NOTE: Use zero if the panel is flat. (Wimpg1 will be reset
                 to zero if PANDA2 detects that the panel is flat).

           NOTE: If the panel is curved:
           Whatever circumferential angle the panel spans,
           pretend for the purpose of this input datum that it
           represents part of a complete (360 deg.) cylindrical
           shell that has an out-of-roundness with amplitude Wimpg1.
           If Wimpg2 (see next paragraph) is zero, the sign of
           Wimpg1 is significant. Otherwise, Wimpg1 will have the
           same sign as Wimpg2 in the calculations in PANDA2.

      (b) overall buckling modal imperfection amplitude, Wimpg2.
           NOTE: If the panel is stiffened, the sign of the
           overall buckling modal imperfection Wimpg2 is important
           because it affects how the panel skin and stiffener
           cross sections of the imperfect panel become loaded
           under the applied loads. Type H(elp) for a discussion
           of this when you are prompted for Wimpg2.

      (c) if there are rings, inter-ring buckling modal imperfection
           amplitude, Wpan.  NOTE: The sign of Wpan is important for
           the same reason given in Paragraph (b).

      (d) local buckling modal imperfection amplitude, Wloc.
           The sign of Wloc is NOT significant.

345.1 Initial bowing imperfection amplitude(type H for sign), Wimpg
345.2 
      Positive Wimpg is downward in Fig. 9 of the long 1987 PANDA2
      paper. The imperfection varies as sin(pi*x/L) in the axial
      coordinate direction. A positive Wimpg causes the bottom skin
      surface to be convex.  (The bottom surface is the surface of
      the skin opposite to that to which the stringers are attached).
      There is no prestress, either membrane or bending, associated
      with this bowing imperfection. It is hard to make a general
      statement whether positive or negative Wimpg will lead to earlier
      failure: Positive Wimpg combined with axial compression tends to
      cause greater compressive loads in the stringer web and flange
      and therefore tends to cause earlier buckling and rolling of
      these parts of the structure; Negative Wimpg combined with axial
      compression tends to cause greater compression in the panel
      skin and therefore earlier local buckling and higher local
      bending stresses in the postbuckling regime. It may be a good
      idea to set up two load cases, both with the same mechanical
      loads,  the first with a positive Wimpg and the second with
      a negative Wimpg. Then the optimized design will be good no
      matter what the sign of the bowing imperfection wimpg is.

      If in doubt, use a NEGATIVE bowing imperfection (panel skin
      compressed more than stringer tips).

346.1 Do you want to change WIMPG to a negative value?
346.2 
      If this set of applied loads is associated with only one value
      of bowing imperfection WIMPG, then it is generally best to use
      a negative value.
      
347.1 Initial local imperfection amplitude (must be positive), Wloc
347.2 
      In PANDA2 the local imperfection is assumed to have the same
      shape as the local buckling mode. Use a positive number for the
      amplitude, Wloc.

      If you set Wloc = 0.0, PANDA2 will automatically reset Wloc
      to a value equal to ten percent of the thickness of the panel
      skin midway between stringers. This is a rather large initial
      imperfection.  If you want to analyze a perfect panel, please
      provide a very small, but nonzero and positive, Wloc. 

348.1 Out-of-roundness, Wimpg1=(Max.diameter-Min.diam)/4, Wimpg1
348.2 
      The initial overall out-of-roundness amplitude is given by:

         Wimpg1 = (Max. diameter - Min. diameter)/4.
 
      NOTE: Use zero if the panel is flat. (Wimpg1 will be reset
            to zero if PANDA2 detects that the panel is flat).

      NOTE: If the panel is curved:
             Whatever circumferential angle the panel spans,
             pretend for the purpose of this input datum that the
             panel represents part of a complete (360 deg.) cylindrical
             shell that has an out-of-roundness with amplitude
             Wimpg1 = (Max. diameter - Min. diameter)/4.

349.1 Initial buckling modal general imperfection amplitude, Wimpg2
349.2 
      In PANDA2 the general imperfection is assumed to have the same
      shape as the general buckling mode obtained from a PANDA-type
      (closed form) analysis of the cylindrical panel.

      IMPORTANT NOTES:
      If the panel has axial stiffeners (stringers) and no rings and
      if the analysis model IQUICK = 0, then:
        You should consider optimizing with both negative and positive
        Wimpg2. Under axial loading, negative Wimpg2 gives rise to
        more compression in the skin than in the tips of the stringers.
        The opposite is true for positive Wimpg2. You can optimize for
        both positive and negative Wimpg2 by introduction of two load
        cases in MAINSETUP with everything the same in each except the
        sign of Wimpg2.
      With IQUICK=1, optimization with both positive and negative
      Wimpg2 is automatically performed within a single load case.
      
      If the panel is clamped for buckling, has stringers, and is flat
      the effective simply supported length may be less than the actual
      length: L(eff) = LENMOD*L, where LENMOD is computed by PANDA2. In
      this case, the Wimpg2 that you provide should be given by:
            Wimpg2(your input) = Wimpg2(actual)*2*LENMOD**2
      You can obtain LENMOD by running PANDAOPT with ITYPE=2, NPRINT=2
      and search the resulting *.OPM file for the string: LENMOD

350.1 Initial buckling modal inter-ring imperfection amplitude,Wpan
350.2 
      This imperfection is used only if the panel is curved and
      there are both stringers and rings in the PANDA2 model.
      (See ITEM 124. in PANDA2.NEWS). In PANDA2 the inter-ring
      imperfection is assumed to have the same shape as the
      inter-ring buckling mode.
      
      IMPORTANT NOTE: If IQUICK = 0, then:
        You should consider optimizing with both negative and
        positive Wpan. Under axial loading, negative Wpan gives rise to
        more compression in the skin than in the tips of the stringers.
        The opposite is true for positive Wpan. You can optimize for
        both positive and negative Wpan by introduction of two load
        cases in MAINSETUP with everything the same in each except the
        sign of Wpan.
      With IQUICK=1, optimization with both positive and negative
      Wpan is automatically performed within a single load case.

351.1 Initial local imperfection amplitude (must be positive), Wloc
351.2 
      In PANDA2 the local imperfection is assumed to have the same
      shape as the local buckling mode. Use a positive number for the
      amplitude, Wloc.

      If you set Wloc = 0.0, PANDA2 will automatically reset Wloc
      to a value equal to ten percent of the thickness of the panel
      skin midway between stringers. This is a rather large initial
      imperfection.  If you want to analyze a perfect panel, please
      provide a very small, but nonzero and positive, Wloc. 

352.1 Do you want PANDA2 to change imperfection amplitudes (see H(elp))?
352.2 
      Default is "Y". If you answer "Y" then PANDA2 may automatically
      reduce the amplitude of one or more of the buckling modal
      imperfections that it judges to be larger than that which would
      be easily detectable by the most casual inspection and therefore
      greater than that represented by a reasonable tolerance. It was
      necessary to allow PANDA2 to do this in order:

      (a) to try to avoid extreme oscillations of design margins from
      design iteration to iteration, and

      (b) to avoid production of optimum designs that are too
      conservative.

      Since the initial buckling modal imperfections have the unknown
      shapes of the local, inter-ring, and general buckling modes,
      the user cannot know ahead of time whether or not a given 
      imperfection amplitude is too large. An imperfection of given
      amplitude is easier to detect if it has a shape that has short
      axial and circumferential wavelengths than if it has long
      wavelengths because it is the wall out-of-plane rotations that
      are most likely to be detected. These out-of-plane rotations
      increase inversely with the critical buckling modal wavelengths.
      The user does not know in advance what the various wavelengths
      of the critical buckling modes are.

      An answer "N" means STRATEGY (1) in [17] is followed.
      An answer "Y" means STRATEGY (2) in [17] is followed.

      If you answer "Y", PANDA2 will take the following three steps:

      Step 1. Use the critical buckling mode shape,
        (m,n,slope)=(axial halfwaves, circ. halfwaves, nodal line slope)
        corresponding to the PERFECT rather than the IMPERFECT geometry
        if the axial halfwavelength of the critical buckling mode of the
        IMPERFECT geometry is less than or equal to half the user-
        specified axial halfwavelength of the imperfection.

      Step 2. Change the amplitude of whatever imperfection results
        from Step 1 by the factor (ratio):
        (axial halfwavelength of the critical buckling mode)/
        (user-specified axial halfwavelength of the imperfection)

      Step 3. Reduce the buckling modal imperfection amplitude remaining
        after Steps 1 and 2 if it leads to an out-of-plane wall rotation
        that is greater than 0.1 radian. If this happens a warning such as
        the following (which happens to apply only to the local buckling
        modal imperfection) will be printed in the *.OPM file:

       ******** WARNING ******** WARNING ******** WARNING *********
       THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL HALFWAVELENGTH OF THE LOCAL IMPERFECTION
       Wimp(local), WHICH HAS THE SAME FORM AS THE LOCAL BUCKLING
       MODE, IS SHORT, WHILE ITS AMPLITUDE IS RATHER HIGH:
       Circumferential halfwavelength of Wimp(local),   Wlength=2.97E+01
       Present amplitude of the local imperfection, Wimp(local)=1.67E+00
       PLEASE CONSIDER REDUCING Wimp(local). YOUR DESIGN MAY BE TOO
       CONSERVATIVE.
       ************* END WARNING *********** END WARNING **********

      The following material printed in the *.OPM file informs the user
      by what factor the user-supplied imperfection amplitude was reduced
      in this case in order to keep the maximum out-of-plane wall rotation
      less than 0.1 rad:

       LOCAL AND GLOBAL IMPERFECTION AMPLITUDES,
       AMPLITUDE MODIFIERS THAT KEEP MAX. WALL ROTATION GENERATED
       BY THE MODAL IMPERFECTION COMPONENT LESS THAT 0.1 RADIAN,
       AND AMPLIFICATION FACTORS TO ACCOUNT FOR GROWTH OF THE
       INITIAL IMPERFECTIONS DURING LOADING:
                           USER-PROVIDED   AMPLITUDE   AMPLIFICATION
                           IMPERFECTION    MODIFIER    FACTOR WYYAMP
                             AMPLITUDE      AMPMDi     FROM LOADING
       local imperfection    1.6750E+00    5.4998E-01    1.0182E+00

      In the above case the local buckling modal imperfection amplitude
      actually used by PANDA2 is 1.675 x 0.54998 = 0.92122.

      You may, however, want to answer the question "N". For example,
      if you wish to use PANDA2 to evaluate a damaged panel with a
      known (probably rather large) initial imperfection, you will not
      want PANDA2 to "take charge" and automatically modify the
      imperfection amplitude as it did in the above example.

353.1 Maximum allowable average axial strain (type H for HELP)
353.2 

      This input permits you to account for strain (stress)
      concentrations near bolt holes. Use a value such that if
      this value were reached along axial lines of fasteners,
      there would be no failure because of the fasteners. This
      allowable is placed in the load loop because you may want
      to provide different values for tension and compression.

      A factor of safety of unity is used in PANDA2 for this
      allowable. Also, the margin is calculated using only the
      axial strain component, EXAVE.  The concept of effective strain
      resulting from the three in-plane strain components, EXAVE,
      EYAVE and EXYAVE, is not used.  Therefore, you must set the
      maximum allowable average axial strain small enough to yield
      a reliable design.

      If you are not concerned with this, just type zero or a
      large number. Use a positive number. Units are strain, not percent.

354.0 
      Next, you will be asked, "Do you want a complete analysis?"
      Usually you should respond Y (or just hit "ENTER"). This question
      refers to analysis with stress and buckling constraints generated
      from both Subcase 1 (midlength or midbay) and Subcase 2 (panel ends
      or at rings).  (Note that for some loadings the "complete" analysis
      has only a single subcase, Subcase 1. Then your response to this
      question, although required, will not matter). Ordinarily you will
      want the panel to be optimized accounting both for the behavior at
      its midlength (midbay) and at its ends (at rings). However, there
      are doubtless cases for which this conservative approach may
      generate overly heavy panels. For example, there may exist rather
      local stress concentrations in the panel skin and local buckling
      of the panel skin only in the neighborhoods of rings in a curved
      panel or at the ends of a clamped curved or flat panel with applied
      pressure. The use of a "complete" analysis might then cause the
      panel skin to be overly thick over most of the panel length in order
      that it not buckle due to local compressive resultants present only
      near rings (or at ends). The best design might well be a panel the 
      skin of which is thinner midway between rings than near rings. The
      skin near rings would be thickened locally to reduce stress and
      prevent local buckling there. Since PANDA2 does not handle axially
      varying thickness or stringer cross section directly, you might want
      to perform two sequential optimizations, the first in which you do
      the "complete" analysis in order to ensure that the worst conditions
      generated by both Subcases 1 and 2 are included, and the second in
      which only the conditions for Subcase 1 constrain the design. Before
      doing the second optimization, you might have to rerun DECIDE in
      order to eliminate the stringer and ring spacings and perhaps the
      stringer cross section dimensions as decision variables, and to reset
      lower bounds on stringer and ring thicknesses and perhaps web heights
      and flange widths to the values obtained from the first optimization.
      This you might need to do to ensure that the final design can be
      fabricated and that it will survive the conditions at Subcase 2,
      which is not checked during the second optimization. Both the first
      optimum design (from the "complete" analysis) and the second optimum
      design (from the "Subcase 1 only" analysis) you would incorporate
      into the actual panel during manufacture: the panel skin and stringer
      dimensions from the first optimum design would be used for a certain
      axial length of panel near the rings, and the panel skin and stringer
      dimensions and ring dimensions from the second optimum design would
      be used for the panel midlength (or midbay) region and for the rings.
      You would have to specify the axial extent of each of the two regions.
      Unfortunately, PANDA2 cannot do this for you. You will have to rely
      on engineering judgment. If you use PANDA2 this way to generate
      designs that are really beyond the straightforward scope of PANDA2,
      it is especially important for you to apply some general-purpose
      finite element code such as STAGS to verify the feasiblility of your
      fancy hybrid optimum design before you actually fabricate the panel.
      SEE ITEM 175 IN PANDA2.NEWS FOR MORE INFORMATION AND AN EXAMPLE.

355.0
      SOME ADVICE ON MODELING WHEN NORMAL PRESSURE IS PRESENT:
      If you are designing a panel that has both stringers and rather
      large rings, and you expect that in the prebuckling phase there
      may be significant bending between these large rings due to the
      pressure, then set up models in which there are stringers only.
      The entire axial length of each model must be equal to the
      spacing of the large rings. The boundary conditions along the
      edges where the large rings are supposed to be should be clamped
      for the prebuckling phase and simply supported for the buckling
      phase of the analysis if the stringers are not tapered in the
      neighborhoods of the large rings.  If the stringers are tapered
      near the large rings, then use simple support for both the
      prebuckling and the buckling phases of the analysis.

356.1 Do you want a "complete" analysis (type H for "Help")?
356.2 
      Usually you should respond Y (or just hit "Enter"). This question
      refers to analysis with stress and buckling constraints generated
      from both Subcase 1 (midlength or midbay) and Subcase 2 (panel ends
      or at rings).  (Note that for some loadings the "complete" analysis
      has only a single subcase, Subcase 1. Then your response to this
      question, although required, will not matter). Please scroll up and
      read carefully the long paragraph printed just above the prompt.

      If you plan to answer 'N', make sure that you
      have previously rerun DECIDE with new lower bounds of decision
      variables for stiffener thicknesses and cross section dimensions
      now set equal to values obtained for the optimum design obtained
      with the "complete" analysis and with stiffener spacings eliminated
      as decision variables. SEE ITEM 175 IN PANDA2.NEWS FOR MORE
      INFORMATION AND AN EXAMPLE.

357.1 Have you rerun DECIDE with new decision variables and lower bounds?
357.2 
      Before doing the second optimization, you might have to rerun DECIDE
      to eliminate the stringer and ring spacings and perhaps the stringer
      cross section dimensions as decision variables, and to reset lower
      bounds on stringer and ring thicknesses and perhaps web heights and
      flange widths. This you might need to do to ensure that the final
      design can be fabricated and that it will survive the conditions at
      Subcase 2, which is not rechecked during the "incomplete" analysis.
      Please be very careful when using the "incomplete" (Subcase 1 only)
      analysis to generate optimum designs with PANDA2. Be sure to use a
      general-purpose finite element program such as STAGS in order to
      verify the feasiblility of your final optimum design which has two
      sets of dimensions along its length, one appropriate for conditions
      near the panel ends (or at rings) and the other appropriate for
      conditions in the midlength (or midbay) region(s). Remember, that
      PANDA2 cannot analyze such a panel directly. SEE ITEM 175 IN
      PANDA2.NEWS FOR MORE INFORMATION.

358.1 Are you sure you want just Subcase 1 checked in this run?
358.2 
      Please be very careful when using the "incomplete" (Subcase 1 only)
      analysis to generate optimum designs with PANDA2. Both the first
      optimum design (from the "complete" analysis) and the second optimum
      design (from the "Subcase 1 only" analysis) you will incorporate
      into the actual panel during manufacture: the panel skin and stringer
      dimensions from the first optimum design will be used for a certain
      axial length of panel near the rings, and the panel skin and stringer
      dimensions and ring dimensions from the second optimum design will
      be used for the panel midlength (or midbay) region and for the rings.
      You will have to specify the axial extent of each of the two regions.
      Unfortunately, PANDA2 cannot do this for you. You will have to rely
      on engineering judgment. If you use PANDA2 this way to generate

      optimum design. SEE ITEM 175 IN PANDA2.NEWS FOR MORE INFORMATION AND

359.1 Want to provide another load set ?
359.2 
      You can provide up to 5 sets of loads, imperfections, and
      factors of safety, that is, up to 5 sets of
      [Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My, Nx0, Ny0, p, Wimp(global), Wimp(local),
      FSGEN, FSPAN, FSLOC, FSBSTR, FSSTR, and temperature distributions].

360.1 Prebuckling phase: choose 0=simple support or 1=clamping
360.2 
      This prompt is used for boundary conditions for flat panels only.

      What is meant here is the boundary conditions for the two
      edges that lie in the plane of the screen and parallel to this
      plane. The clamped edges can move axially in a uniform manner,
      so that the panel can become axially loaded by the applied Nx
      and/or Nx0. 

362.1 Prebuckling: choose 0=bending included; 2=use membrane theory
362.2 
      This prompt is used for boundary conditions for curved (cylindrical)
      panels only. Please reply either 0 or 2 .

      What is meant here is the b.c. for the two CURVED boundaries only.
      The straight boundaries, that is, the two edges that are normal to
      the plane of the screen, are always assumed to be symmetry conditions
      for the prebuckling phase of the analysis (but uniform in-plane
      shearing is permitted).

      0 = Prebuckling axisymmetric axial bending is included. Please see 
          pp 495-498 in the paper, "Approximate method for the...",
          Computers & Structures, Vol.59, pp 489-527, 1996 for an
          explanation of the axisymmetric prebuckling theory used in PANDA2.

      2 = The prebuckled state is derived from membrane theory. That is,
          both the stringers and rings are smeared out and the presence
          of constraint along the two curved edges and where rings occur
          is ignored. The prebuckled membrane deformation is uniform.

      Cases in which membrane prebuckling theory is used will run quicker
      because there is only one Subcase per load set. However, the fact is
      that conditions are actually different midway between rings from
      those that exist at the rings because of prebuckling axisymmetric
      bending. You may want to optimize first with use of membrane theory,
      then permit bending for further optimization.

      If the panel is curved and there are no rings, use membrane theory.

      PANDA2 will next ask you to provide an axial halfwavelength of
      the general buckling modal imperfection. For axially stiffened
      panels or panels under external pressure or flat panels, please
      use the axial length of the panel. PANDA2 uses the axial half-
      wavelength you give here to change your given amplitude of the general
      buckling modal imperfection if the axial halfwavelength of the
      general buckling mode of the perfect shell turns out to be 
      different from that you will next provide here (imperfection amplitude
      becomes smaller if the axial halfwavelength of the critical buckling
      mode of the perfect shell is shorter than that you provide here and
      larger if it is longer than that you will provide here). The purpose
      of this strategy is to prevent wild swings in margins corresponding
      to small changes in design caused by abruptly different critical
      general buckling mode shapes. Please see [17] and ITEM NO. 525
      of ...panda2/doc/panda2.news for more details.

366.1 Axial halfwavelength of typical general buckling mode, AXLWAV
366.2 
      For flat panels or panels with significant external pressure
      use AXLWAV = the axial length of the panel, unless you are designing
      a cylindrical panel or shell that is much, much longer than its
      circumferential radius, and then you might want to use a smaller
      value for AXLWAV than that.

      For axially stiffened cylindrical panels or laminated composite
      cylindrical panels you might use an axial length AXLWAV equal to
      the SMALLER of 1. the axial length of the panel or 2. between two
      and eight times the circumferential radius of the perfect
      cylindrical panel. 

      NOTE: If the critical general buckling mode has a LONGER axial
            halfwavelength than AXLWAV, then the initial user-
            specified imperfection amplitude will be INCREASED by the
            ratio:

            (axial halfwavelength of the critical buckling mode)/AXLWAV

             Of course, if the critical general buckling mode has a
             SHORTER axial halfwavelength than AXLWAV, then the initial
             user-specified imperfection amplitude will be REDUCED by
             the same ratio.

367.1 Do you want PANDA2 to find the general imperfection shape?
367.2  
      Almost always answer Y (yes). PANDA2 will then find the
      (m,n,slope) for the general buckling mode, in which
      m = number of axial halfwaves
      n = number of circumferential halfwaves
      s = slope of the buckling nodal lines.
      The imperfection shape is assumed to be the same as
      the general buckling mode shape.

      If you for some reason should answer N (no), then you
      must next supply values of (m,n), called MUSER and NUSER.
      In the section of PANDA2 that computes general buckling
      imperfection sensitivity, PANDA2 will not search over
      (m,n) space to find the critical general buckling modal
      imperfection shape, but instead will use only the values
      (MUSER,NUSER) that you will next supply. PANDA2 will
      continue to search over "s-space" (s = slope of buckling nodal
      lines) for a minimum general buckling load factor with
      respect to s for given and fixed (m,n) = (MUSER, NUSER). 

368.1 Number of axial halfwaves over the length of the panel, MUSER
368.2 
      MUSER must be greater than zero. PANDA2 will use ONLY this
      number of axial halfwaves in the section on general
      buckling imperfection sensitivity.

369.1 Number of circumferential halfwaves over the panel, NUSER
369.2
      NUSER must be greater than zero. PANDA2 will use ONLY this
      number of circumferential halfwaves in the section on general
      buckling imperfection sensitivity.

370.1 Buckling: choose 0=simple support or 1=clamping 
370.2 
      What is meant here is the boundary conditions for the two
      edges that lie in the plane of the screen and parallel to this
      plane  (the two curved edges if the panel is cylindrical).

      Use simple support if the ends of the panel represent the
      locations of rings, as discussed above. Use simple support
      if the stringers are tapered at the ends of the panel.

      NOTE: If you are using PANDA2 to analyze a ring-stiffened
            cylindrical shell, use simple support (0) here. If you
            have chosen the arc length of the panel in the plane of
            the screen to be equal to pi*radius of the cylinder,
            then the number of half waves over this arc length will
            be equal to the number of full waves in the buckling
            pattern around the entire circumference of a complete
            (360 deg.) cylindrical shell. Thus, the PANDA2 analysis
            of a panel spanning 180 deg. is equivalent to an
            analysis of a complete (360 deg.) cylindrical shell.

371.1 Starting load factor for Load System A, STLD(1)
371.2 
      Use 1.0 for INDIC = 1 (linear buckling) analyses.

      For transient restarts from nonlinear static runs that got stuck
      because of singularities on the primary load path, use the load
      factor corresponding to one or two steps back from the last step
      converged. STAGS does not yet properly store information for the
      last step successfully completed if the run stopped because of
      maximum number of cuts in step. For example, if STAGS could not
      get a converged solution for Load Step 31, then for some reason
      Load Step 30 is not properly stored. Therefore, you should use
      the load factor corresponding to Load Step 29 or perhaps 28.
      PANDA2 will automatically supply an appropriate value for the
      actual load factor to be used in the transient analysis. This
      PANDA2-provided value will be a bit higher than the highest load
      factor reached by STAGS in the case so that the structure will
      start to move to a new state.

372.1 Load factor increment for Load System A, STEP(1)
372.2 
      Use zero for linear buckling analysis (INDIC=1) and transient
      analysis (INDIC=6).

373.1 Maximum load factor for Load System A, FACM(1)
373.2 
      Use FACM(1) = 1.0 for eigenvalue (INDIC=1) and transient (INDIC=6)
      analysis types.

374.1 Starting load factor for Load System B, STLD(2)
374.2 
      This input datum is for the STAGS input file.

375.1 Load factor increment for Load System B, STEP(2)
375.2 
      This input datum is for the STAGS input file.

376.1 Maximum load factor for Load System B, FACM(2)
376.2 
      This input datum is for the STAGS input file.

377.1 How many eigenvalues do you want? NEIGS
377.2 
      This input datum is for the STAGS input file.

      If the STAGS analysis type INDIC=1 (buckling of unloaded
      structure) you will probably want NEIGS = 1 to 8.

      If the STAGS analysis type INDIC=5 (vibration of loaded
      structure) you will probably want NEIGS = 1  . The purpose
      of the eigenvalue analysis in this case is to establish a
      reasonable estimate for the time step in a subsequent dynamic
      response analysis.

      If the STAGS analysis type INDIC=4 (buckling of loaded
      structure) you may well want to use NEIGS > 1  . NEIGS must
      be less than twenty.  Probably should be from 4 to 8.

378.1 Choose element type: 480 or 410 or 940 
378.2 

      Descriptions of the 480, 410, and 940 elements appear
      in the STAGS user's manual. The 480 finite element is
      the one favored by the developer of PANDA2.

      The 940 element usually converges from above.

379.1 Nonlinear solution strategy (0=default, 1=full Newton)
379.2 
      This input datum is for the STAGS input file.

      The "default" option (0) causes the modified Newton method
      to be used, which is the NEWT = -1 option on the D-1 record
      in the STAGS input file.

      The "full Newton" option yields NEWT = -20 on the D-1 record.
      Newton iterations are used at every load step.

      For small problems or very fast computers, you might use the
      full Newton method.

380.1 Is stiffener sidesway permitted at the panel edges?
380.2 
      In the PANDA2 model it is assumed that stringer sidesway
      is permitted at the axially loaded ends of the panel,
      provided that the discretized skin-stringer module model is used.
      This is in order to obtain conservative designs. In STAGSMODEL
      and in STAGSUNIT you can choose whether or not this mode of
      deformation can occur. 

      By "stiffener sidesway" is meant a mode of deformation in which
      the tip of the stiffener can deflect sideways (in the y-direction
      in Fig. 9 on p. 492 of the long PANDA2 paper in COMPUTERS AND
      STRUCTURES, 1987).

      In tests of panels "stringer sidesway" is usually prevented by
      friction at the axially loaded ends of the test specimen. In
      actual panels sidesway can occur if the stiffener tips or
      outstanding flanges are not attached to other structure.

      To simulate the PANDA2 model with use of IQUICK = 0, answer Y.
      If IQUICK = 1 in your PANDA2 model, then you should probably
      answer N.

381.1 Is prebuckling hoop displacement v free at x=0 and XSTAGS?
381.2 
      1. If there is significant in-plane shear loading Nxy or hoop
         loading Ny, answer Y. Otherwise, these applied loads can do
         little work near x=0 and x=XSTAGS and their effects will
         therefore be greatly underestimated in the STAGS model. 

      2. With flat panels, PANDA2 assumes that along the two axially
         loaded edges the axially compressed panel is free to undergo
         transverse (hoop) Poisson ratio expansion in the prebuckling
         phase. Therefore, in a flat panel without transverse stiffeners
         no hoop resultant Ny develops in the panel skin in the PANDA2
         model. If you want the STAGS model to simulate this behavior,
         answer Y.

      3. If the panel is curved and clamped, is unstiffened or has
         stringers only, and is loaded by axial resultant Nx only,
         generally answer N. This will best match the PANDA2 model of
         an axially compressed cylindrical panel without rings.

      If the panel has rings, STAGSMODEL will always act as if you
      answered this question "Y". If you are doubtful about whether or
      not you want prebuckling "v" restraint along the two axially loaded
      ends, run the STAGS case both ways to see what happens. "v" is
      always restrained along these two edges in the bifurcation buckling
      phase.

382.0 
      For optimized designs some design margins may be sensitive to
      small changes in the design variables. It is useful to obtain
      "sensitivity" plots.  This ITYPE = 4 analysis branch allows
      you to obtain plots of design margins v. any design variable
      that you choose. By repeating the ITYPE = 4 analysis for different
      design variables you learn how sensitive the behavior of the
      optimized design is to variation of the design variables.

      The sequence of runs is:

             MAINSETUP, PANDAOPT, CHOOSEPLOT, DIPLOT

      for each design variable for which you want "sensitivity" plots.

      Next, you will be asked to select a design variable, its
      starting value VARBEG, its ending value VAREND, and the number
      of steps NSTEPS from the starting value to the ending value.

383.1 Want to prevent local stringer deformation at panel ends?
383.2 
      This question is asked only for a one-module STAGS model in a
      case for which there is virtually no in-plane shear loading,
      Nxy. If you answer "Y", then no normal displacements are
      allowed in the segments of the stringer at the ends of the
      panel. The question is asked only if you responded "N" to
      the previous prompt,
   
       Is stringer sidesway permitted at the panel ends or rings?

384.1 Choose a design variable (1, 2, 3, ...), IBVAR
384.2 
      Choose an integer from the left-hand column.

385.1 Choose element type (410 or 411 or 480) for panel skin
385.2
      This item is used by STAGSMODEL, not by STAGSUNIT.

      The type of element you choose will be used for the
      part of the panel skin away from the stringers and
      for the stringer webs and outstanding flanges. The base
      under each stringer is modelled with use of the
      411 element unless you choose "480", in which case the
      480 element is used throughout the structure.

      Descriptions of the 410, 411, and 480 elements appear
      in the STAGS user's manual.

      NOTE:  QSTAGS must be used if you choose the 480 element.

386.1 Starting value of the design parameter, VARBEG
386.2 
      Use starting and ending values that are not too far from
      the value you obtained via optimization.

388.1 Ending value of the design parameter, VAREND
388.2 
      Use starting and ending values that are not too far from
      the value you obtained via optimization.

390.1 Do you want to use the default for the number of steps?
390.2 
      The default value of the number of steps, NSTEPS, is 29
      If you do not want the default value, use a value for
      NSTEPS that is less than 29

391.1 Number of steps from VARBEG to VAREND. NSTEPS
391.2 
      NSTEPS must be less than or equal to 29   .

392.1 Number of columns in Unit 1 of compound Part 1, IUNITC
392.2 
      Look for the first line of the "F-1" (or "f-1") records
      in the *.inp file corresponding to Part 1 of the compound
      STAGS model.

      The number of rows and number of columns in unit 1 appear
      there: "$ F-1 NROWS( 1),  NCOLS( 1) unit 1".

393.1 Unit number of the first ring or subring segment, IUNITR
393.2 
      What is wanted here is the unit number of the first
      ring segment or subring segment (whichever is lowest)
      in the first part of the 2-part compound STAGS model.

      This input datum is needed for the second part of a
      compound STAGS model. You can find IUNITR by inspecting
      the *.inp file corresponding to the first part of a
      compound STAGS model. Search for the string, "ring" or
      "subring" (if there exist substiffeners) and look for
      the shell unit number of the first unit processed which
      is a ring segment or a subring segment. That unit number
      is the required input datum, IUNITR .

394.1 Number of stringers in STAGS model of the flat panel
394.2
      NOTE: There are ALWAYS stringers along the two
            longitudinal edges of the panel. Hence the
            number of stringers that you provide as input here
            must be equal to the number of stringer bays
            plus one.

      NOTE: Make sure that the stringer spacing is equal to
            the PANDA2 variable called B(1), or B(STR). You
            may have to run PANDA2 again with B(1) set so that
            there are exactly the right number of uniformly spaced
            stringers over the width (in-screen dimension, L2)
            of the panel. 

395.1 Number of loads at which to compute eigenvalues, NLDS
395.2 
      NLDS must be in the range from 1 to 10 . NLDS must be provided
      in the STAGS input file, *.bin, if INDIC = 4. NLDS is the first
      item on the C-3 record.

396.1 PLDS(i) = load at which STAGS is to compute eigenvalues, PLDS
396.2 
      PLDS(i) must be provided in order of increasing order of load
      factor, that is, PLDS(i) < PLDS(i+1). PLDS(i) must be within
      the range STLD(1).LE.PLDS(i).LE.FACM(1), in which STLD(1) is the
      starting load factor and FACM(1) is the maximum load factor for
      Load Set A ("eigenvalue" load set, that is, the load set that
      is to be multiplied by the eigenvalue in the computation of
      critical load factor. PLDS(i) is in Record C-4 of the *.bin file.

397.1 IXEV = number of eigenvalues to be computed, IXEV
397.2 
      IXEV must be in the range 1 to 10 . IXEV is in C-3 record.

400.1 Edges parallel to screen (0) in-plane deformable; (1) rigid
400.2
      This input is for the STAGS model of the panel generated via
      the command "STAGSUNIT".

      Choose 0 if you think the two edges of the panel that run
      parallel to the rings (panel width-wise coordinate direction
      or circumferential direction) ARE relatively free to deform
      in the x-direction, that is, in the axial direction in the
      plane of the panel skin.

      Choose 1 if you think these two edges of the panel ARE NOT
      free to deform in the x-direction.

      NOTE:  The projection of these two edges onto the surface of
             the undeformed panel are ALWAYS free to move in the
             x-direction as straight lines.

404.0
      Next, you will be asked to provide an index, IBCX0XL, which
      controls the distribution of axial displacement u over the
      heights of the webs of the stringers at axial stations x=0
      and x=XSTAGS, which are the axial coordinates at the two
      axially loaded ends of the STAGS model of the panel.
      The index, IBCX0XL, is defined as follows:

      IBCX0XL=0: no constraint of u is imposed over each stringer
                 web height in the STAGS model of the panel.

      IBCX0XL=1: u=constant is imposed over the height of each
                 stringer web in the STAGS model of the panel.

      There is the following reason for the introduction of the
      index, IBCX0XL: The panel is designed to buckle locally at
      a load less than the design load, that is, the factor of
      safety for local buckling, FSLOC, is less than 0.9. We
      wish to simulate in the STAGS model the same end conditions
      that exist in the PANDA2 model for the precollapsed state
      of the locally postbuckled panel. By forcing the axial
      displacement u to be constant over the heights of the
      stringer webs, we prevent the overall axial bending of the
      stringer-stiffened panel that occurs because of the shift
      in the neutral axis caused by the axial softening of the
      panel skin as it deforms in its locally postbuckled state.

      If you have a panel loaded reasonably far into its locally
      postbuckled state at the design load, say FSLOC is less
      than about 0.7, and if the applied load is equal to the
      design load, and if the STAGS model represents a sub-domain
      of the panel analyzed or optimized by PANDA2 (that is,
      XSTAGS is less than the axial length of the panel optimized
      by PANDA2), then you should probably set IBCXOXL = 1  .
      Otherwise, set IBCX0XL = 0  .

405.1 Stringer web axial displacement index, IBCX0XL=0 or 1
405.2
      IBCX0XL=0: no constraint of u over each stringer web height
                 in the STAGS model of the panel.

      IBCX0XL=1: u=constant over the height of each stringer web
                 in the STAGS model of the panel.
       
      If you have a panel loaded reasonably far into its locally
      postbuckled state at the design load, say FSLOC is less
      than about 0.7, and if the applied load is equal to the
      design load, and if the STAGS model represents a sub-domain
      of the panel analyzed or optimized by PANDA2 (XSTAGS is
      less than the axial length of the panel optimized by
      PANDA2), then you should probably set IBCXOXL = 1  .
      Otherwise, set IBCX0XL = 0  .
      
410.1 N0B   = starting number of circ. waves (buckling analysis)
420.1 NMINB = minimum number of circ. waves  (buckling analysis)
430.1 NMAXB = maximum number of circ. waves  (buckling analysis)
440.1 INCRB = increment in number of circ. waves (buckling)
450.1 NVEC  = number of eigenvalues for each wave number
453.1 Want to include effect of transverse shear deformation?
453.2 
      If you answer  Y  reduction factors are computed for various
      kinds of general, semi-general, and local instability and
      crippling. These factors reduce the eigenvalues computed
      from classical "normals-remain-normal" shell theory. The
      reduction factors are based on Timoshenko beam theory. (See
      pp 132-136 of Timoshenko and Goodier, 2nd edition.) That is,
      a typical reduction factor has the form:

             k = 1/[ 1 + n*Nx*Lambda/(t*G13)]

      in which n is a shape factor (1.2 is now used); Nx is the
      local stress resultant (lb/in, for example); Lambda is the
      critical eigenvalue computed from "normals-remain-normal"
      theory; t is the local effective thickness of the wall; and
      G13 is the local effective transverse shear stiffness.

455.1 IQUICK = quick analysis indicator (0 or 1)
455.2 
      IQUICK = 0 means discrete BOSOR4-type model will be treated
      IQUICK = 1 means only closed-form types of models will be
                 included, except for prediction of the static
                 response of the entire panel and of the panel module
                 to normal pressure.

      For a panel with stringers almost always use IQUICK = 0
      It may be advisable to start out with IQUICK = 1  and to refine the
      design later with the longer IQUICK = 0 type of analysis. However,
      don't overdo the IQUICK = 1 option: it might easily lead to
      unconservative designs! You must use IQUICK = 0 at least once:
      to check that the design is feasible.  You must use IQUICK = 0
      if you want to include any effects of local buckling of panel
      skin or stringer parts.

      With TRUSS-CORE SANDWICH construction, it is best to use IQUICK = 1
      although IQUICK = 0 is available.

458.1 Minimum allowable panel skin total thickness, TMIN
458.2 
      A minimum total thickness of the panel skin laminate may be
      required for reasons of damage control, lightning strike, etc.
         
      If you are not concerned with this, just type zero.

459.1 Use reduced effective stiffness in panel skin (H(elp), Y or N)?
459.2 
      Generally answer Y in order to avoid unconservative designs.
      However, occasionally you may want to answer N in order to avoid
      too much conservativeness for cases for which you believe the
      panel skin is fully effective for overall bending of the panel.
   
      You should answer Y if you panel has any local initial
      imperfection.
     
      If the panel skin is permitted to buckle locally, that is,
      if the factor of safety for local buckling, FSLOC, is
      significantly less than unity (e.g. FSLOC < 0.9) then you
      should always answer Y.

      A "N" answer may be suitable for panels in which the stringer
      spacing  b  is about the same as the stringer height  h  or
      width  w, such as may be the case for hat-stiffened panels
      with closely pitched corrugated skin or for truss-core panels,
      provided that local buckling of the panel skin is not permitted
      to occur.

      If you answer Y to this question, reduced membrane stiffnesses
      C11, C12, C22, and C33 are used for the panel skin segments
      for calculation of overall bending of the panel under uniform
      pressure and for predictions of general instability load factors
      that are used for determination of amplification of axial bowing.

460.1 NPRINT= output index (-1=min. 0=good, 1=ok, 2=more, 3=too much)
460.2 
      Usually use 0 . NPRINT = 0 is recommended for optimization
      analyses, since these analyses produce another useful file, 
      NAME.OPP, which contains the entire design history and is much
      easier to read than the NAME.OPM file. The new plotting capability
      CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT, also makes it less necessary to generate
      lots of printed output. NPRINT = 3 really gets alot of output.
      NPRINT = 2 yields the C(i,j), the force distributions
      in the various parts of the panel module,
      local buckling modal displacements, and resdistributed loads due
      to bowing and local postbuckling behavior. Do not use 2 if you
      are doing an optimization analysis.  When you use 0, please
      make sure to consult the NAME.OPP file (optimization, ITYPE= 1),
      or the NAME.OPI file (test simulation, ITYPE = 3), for more
      information. NPRINT = -1 leads to minimal output (margins and
      design only.

      The developer of PANDA2 generally uses NPRINT = 0 for
      optimization runs (ITYPE=1) and NPRINT = 2 for the analysis of
      a fixed design (ITYPE = 2). NPRINT = 2 generates a large *.OPM
      file, but you can find what you want by searching for the
      strings, "CHAPTER" or "MARGINS" or "WEIGHT".

      On rare occasions you may want to use NPRINT = 2 with ITYPE = 1 .
      When you do this PANDA2 prints out details pertaining to each
      CHAPTER, both for the current design and for the perturbed
      designs, then prints out the matrix of contraint gradients, then
      is that PANDA2 computes the constraint gradient matrix and then
      aborts. You may want to set NPRINT = 2 with ITYPE = 1 in a case
      for which you suspect that there is a bug in the program or
      perhaps in your input data. You can inspect the constraint
      gradient matrix to see if there are any very large gradients that
      might have been generated because of a bug. Then you will want
      to inspect the results for the current and for the perturbed
      designs in an attempt to determine the cause or causes of the
      overly large constraint gradients.

470.0 
      Next, you will be asked to provide an index, ISAND, for the type
      of shell theory to be used in the PANDA-type (closed form)
      buckling analysis. You can choose either ISAND = 0 or ISAND = 1
      or ISAND = 2:
      ISAND = 0 means that Donnell theory will be used (corrected for
                 "live" pressure that effects primarily n = 2 and n = 3
                 buckling load factors of cylindrical shells)
      ISAND = 1 means that Sanders' theory will be used. (ITEMs 128,410)
      ISAND = 2 means that Marlowe's theory will be used. (ITEM 411)
      The Donnell theory kinematic and "work done" terms are appear in
      Eqs (53) and (49b) on p 552 of Vol. 27 of Computers and
      Structures (1987 - "Theoretical basis of the PANDA......", with
      modifications described in ITEM 68 of the file PANDA2.NEWS.
      The Sanders theory is described in ITEMs 128, 410 of PANDA2.NEWS.
      The Marlowe theory is described in ITEM 411 of PANDA2.NEWS.

      The developer of PANDA2 now almost always uses ISAND = 1 . Don't
      worry about computer time. Computers run much faster now than
      they did when the following paragraph was written.

      You should always first do optimization first with ISAND = 0.
      On the last iteration for each "PANDAOPT", PANDA2 automatically
      checks buckling load factors with ISAND = 1 when the user provides
      ISAND = 0 in MAINSETUP. If results from these "last" iterations
      are significantly different from those corresponding to ISAND = 0,
      then the optimization must be run with ISAND = 1 or 2. ISAND = 1
      or 2 requires much more computer time than does ISAND = 0. Results
      from ISAND = 2 are rarely different from those from ISAND = 1.

471.1 Index for type of shell theory (0 or 1 or 2), ISAND
471.2  
      ISAND = 0 means Donnell theory is used (with appropriate
                 correction for "live" pressure effect)
      ISAND = 1 means Sanders theory is used (See PANDA2.NEWS
                 ITEM 128, 410 for details).
      ISAND = 2 means Marlowe theory is used (see PANDA2.NEWS
                 ITEM 411 for details).

      The developer of PANDA2 now almost always uses ISAND = 1 . Don't
      worry about computer time. Computers run much faster now than
      they did when the following paragraph was written.

      Generally use ISAND = 0, as it runs much faster on the computer.
      In optimization runs (ITYPE=1) in which ISAND = 0,  PANDA2
      automatically checks margins with use of ISAND = 1 after the last
      design iteration in the current set of design iterations. If you
      use ISAND = 0, check the end of the *.OPM file to see if there
      are any significantly negative margins generated from the buckling
      analyses in which ISAND = 1. If so, then do optimization with
      ISAND = 1 or 2. You will rarely, if ever, need to use ISAND = 2,
      since for practical panels the Sanders and Marlowe theories give
      essentially the same results.
 
480.0 
      Next, you will be asked: 
      "Does the postbuckling axial wavelength of local buckles change?"
      What is meant is: "Does the postbuckling axial wavelength of local
      buckles change continuously as the applied load is increased above
      the load which causes initial local buckling of the panel skin
      between rings and stringers?"

      Just hit "Enter" if you don't know. The question is relevant only
      for analyses with IQUICK = 0, as it applies only to the postbuckling
      analysis, which is based on the discretized single panel module
      model. The default is "Y", and in practically all cases you should
      answer "Y" (or hit "Enter", which has the same effect). You should
      always answer "Y" if this run is to be an optimization run.

      You might want to answer "N" if your purpose in using PANDA2 is to
      generate post-local-buckling 3x3 tangent stiffness matrices to be
      compared with results from STAGS or some other general-purpose
      finite element computer code. In panels with the ratio of ring
      spacing to stringer spacing less than about 5 or 6, the axial
      wavelength of local buckling of the skin often stays constant
      for a rather large range in load above the initial local buckling
      load, especially in cases where axial compression Nx predominates
      and the applied in-plane shear load Nxy is small. 

482.1 Does the postbuckling axial wavelength of local buckles change?
482.2 
      What is meant is: "Does the postbuckling axial wavelength of local
      buckles change continuously as the applied load is increased above
      the load which causes initial local buckling of the panel skin
      between rings and stringers?"

      Just hit "return" if you don't know. ("return" yields the default
      value "Y"). If you have a definite reason for "freezing" the
      number of axial halfwaves in the post-local-buckling pattern at
      the critical value for local bifurcation buckling, then answer "N".
      For example, you may want to answer "N" if the purpose of your
      PANDA2 run is to compare 3x3 membrane tangent stiffness matrices
      from PANDA2 with those from STAGS or some other general-purpose
      finite element computer program.

      You will practically always want to answer "Y" (or hit "return").

490.1 Do you have a good estimate of the buckling mode?
490.2 
      If you just calculated the buckling mode using the
      discrete model, and you have only changed the design
      by a small amount, then answer Y. Otherwise,
      answer N.

492.0
      Next, you will be asked, "Want to suppress general buckling
      mode with many axial waves?"

      You should usually answer N. Your answer affects the results
      only for ring-stiffened cylindrical panels subjected to
      external pressure.  In such cases there may be two types of
      general buckling (buckling of skin and stiffeners together):

         (1) general buckling in a mode with one axial halfwave.
         (2) general buckling in a mode with many axial halfwaves.

      If you answer Y, PANDA2 may set up a constraint condition that
      forces Mode Type (2) to have a load factor that is at least
      5 per cent higher than that associated with Mode Type (1).
      NOTE: THIS SPECIAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT SOMETIMES CAUSES THE
      DESIGN TO DRIFT AWAY FROM THE OPTIMUM CONFIGURATION. THEREFORE
      ANSWER "Y" ONLY IF YOU HAVE FIRST FOUND AN OPTIMUM WITH A "N"
      ANSWER. Answer H(elp) for further explanation, in particular.
      under what loading conditions the "many-axial-halfwave"
      buckling mode is to be suppressed.      

493.1 Want to suppress general buckling mode with many axial waves?
493.2 
      Both types of buckling modes generally have several halfwaves
      over the circumference of the cylindrical (deep) panel or shell.
      Depending on the spacing and depth of the rings, either of these
      modes might be critical. If you answer N, PANDA2 will accept
      whichever type of general instability mode corresponds to the
      lowest general instability load factor. If you answer Y, PANDA2
      will set up a constraint condition that forces the general buckling
      load factor associated with the mode type (2) to be at least
      5 per cent higher than that associated with the mode type (1).
      This special constraint condition may make it difficult to settle
      on the best optimum: With successive PANDAOPTs, the designs, while
      feasible, may drift away from previously found configurations that
      weigh less. Therefore, it is best to start by answering N, finding
      an optimum design, then anwering Y and continuing, then returning
      to answering N again and doing more PANDAOPTs. NOTE: If you answer
      "Y", you may want to do a series of optimizations with fixed ring
      spacing. (Eliminate the ring spacing as a decision variable.)
      
      More on this item: A control integer IHIAXL equals 0 if the user
      answers "N" and IHIAXL = 1 if the user answers "Y". ILAMHI is
      another control integer that depends on the value of IHIAXL and
      on a third integer, IMLOC, to be explained next. ILAMHI is
      initially set equal to zero, and IMLOC is initially set equal
      to unity.
 
      IMLOC is a switch that determines whether or not general 
      buckling load factors are to be saved corresponding to both low
      and high numbers of axial halfwaves in the buckling mode. If
      yes, then IMLOC = 0.  If IHIAXL and ILAMHI are both unity
      (IHIAXL is a user-supplied index and ILAMHI, initially zero,
      is possibly reset later), a constraint condition is set up by
      means of which the buckling load factor associated with the
      general buckling mode with the high number of axial halfwaves
      is forced to be at least 5 per cent higher than that associated
      with the general buckling mode with thelow number of axial
      halfwaves.

      In order for IMLOC to be set to zero, the norm of the applied
      axial and hoop stress resultants, sqrt(Nx^2 + Ny^2), must
      be greater than ten times the applied in-plane shear resultant
      Nxy, the hoop resultant Ny must by greater than 1.9 times the
      axial resultant Nx, and both Nx and Ny must be negative
      (compressive loading).
    
494.0 
      Next, you will be asked, "Do you want to double-check PANDA-type
      eigenvalues?"  Please answer H for HELP if you are not familiar
      with this prompt. 

      This double-check can take lots of computer time.  Generally
      answer N if the panel is flat.  Generally answer N if you
      plan to do optimization (ITYPE=1) or test simulation (ITYPE=3).
      Generally answer N if you are including transverse shear
      deformation effects: LOTS of computer time is required!

      The "double-check" very rarely has any effect on the results.
      However, if you are running an ITYPE=2 (fixed design) analysis
      for a final design configuration of a curved panel, you might
      answer Y.

495.1 Do you want to double-check PANDA-type eigenvalues [type (H)elp]?
495.2 
      This double-check can take lots of computer time.  Generally
      answer N if the panel is flat.  Generally answer N if you
      plan to do optimization (ITYPE=1) or test simulation (ITYPE=3).
      Generally answer N if you are including transverse shear
      deformation effects: LOTS of computer time is required!
      Generally answer Y if you are analyzing a fixed design of a
      curved panel in which in-plane shear loading is present and
      you are neglecting transverse shear deformation effects.
      Answer N if you are not near an optimum design. If you are
      near an optimum, or if you are suspicious of the load
      factors from the PANDA-type (closed form) analysis, answer
      Y.  If you answer Y and if there is in-plane shear loading
      or anisotropic terms in the C(i,j) matrix (constitutive law),
      then PANDA2 will check the minimum buckling load factors
      obtained by an initial (partial) search in slope space (slope
      of the nodal lines in the buckling mode shape) by calculating
      eigenvalues over a range of nodal line slopes from zero to
      10.0 for every wavenumber combination (m,n). This extra search
      takes more computer time, of course, so it shouldn't be done
      unless you feel you are near an optimum design or you doubt
      the PANDA-type eigenvalues.  (There is a partial double-check
      even if you answer N).

496.1 Do you want symmetry conditions along the straight edges?
496.2 
      This question applies to STAGS models generated by STAGSUNIT.

      This applies only to the behavior of cylindrical shells.
      You should ordinarily answer N (no). However, if there is
      insignificant in-plane shear loading and if there is
      insignificant anisotropy, that is, if the slope of the
      buckling nodal lines is zero, then you might want to answer
      Y (yes) in order to produce STAGS models of reasonable
      size. For example, you could construct a STAGS model in which
      only one full circumferential wave of the critical general
      buckling mode is to be included in the model. Symmetry conditions
      applied to the generators will yield the same behavior as
      that from a model that includes the entire cylindrical shell.

497.0
      Next you will be asked to make a choice between two variations
      of the local postbuckling theory to be applied in your runs:

       (0) "transverse inextensional"       (0 is the preferred option)
       (1) "transverse extensional"

      The 0 option is preferred because it leads to more conservative
      designs and generally seems to agree better with test results,
      especially with regard to prediction of the number of axial
      halfwaves in the postbuckling regime. Also, the nonlinear
      equations governing the postbuckled state converge more reliably.

      The "transverse extensional" theory may agree better with
      tests and other analyses if the edges of the panel normal to the
      screen cannot deform in the plane of the panel (deform in the 
      y-direction, that is, the direction in the plane of the panel
      and normal to the edges that run parallel to the stringers).
      However, Newton method fails to converge more often than is
      the case for the "inextensional" theory.

      The "transverse inextensional" theory is most appropriate if the
      edges of the panel normal to the screen are free to deform in the
      plane of the panel. This theory is generally conservative, as it
      leads to the prediction of local buckles with larger amplitudes.

      NOTE:  The projections of the two longitudinal edges (edges normal
             to the screen) onto the surface of the undeformed panel are
             ALWAYS free to move in the y-direction as straight lines.

498.1 Choose (0=transverse inextensional; 1=transverse extensional)
498.2 
      You must choose 1 if there are rings.

      The 0 option is preferred if there are no rings because it is
      more conservative and seems to agree better with test results
      and results in the literature.

      This question might also be phrased:
      "Edges normal to screen (0) in-plane deformable; (1) in-plane rigid"

      Which option you choose depends on the actual boundary conditions
      that govern the inplane deformation (deformation in the y-direction,
      that is, the deformation in the plane of the panel skin and normal
      to the edge) of the two edges of the panel that are normal to the
      plane of the screen.

      You might make two runs, using 1 in the first and 0 in the
      second to see how much impact this choice has on the results for
      a fixed design or on optimum designs.  Use of the 0 option
      usually leads to more conservative designs than use of the 1
      option.

499.1 Edges normal to screen (0) in-plane deformable; (1) rigid
499.2 
      This input is for the STAGS model of the panel generated via
      the command "STAGSMODEL" or the command "STAGSUNIT".

      Choose 0 if you think the two edges of the panel that run
      parallel to the stringers (axial stiffeners) ARE relatively
      free to deform in the y-direction, that is, in the direction
      normal to the edge and in the plane of the panel skin.

      Choose 1 if you think these two edges of the panel ARE NOT
      free to deform in the y-direction.

      NOTE:  The projection of these two edges onto the surface of
             the undeformed panel are ALWAYS free to move in the
             y-direction as straight lines.

500.1 Choose type of analysis (ITYPE = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5)
500.2  
      1  means an optimization analysis will be performed.
         Make sure that you have chosen decision variables, linked
         variables, geometrical inequality constraints, and escape
         variables via DECIDE.

      2  means PANDA2 will perform a buckling/stress analysis of a
         fixed design for up to 5 load sets.

      3  means PANDA2 will simulate a test of a panel with fixed
         design: For one of the load sets the behavior of the panel
         under monotonically increasing loads will be investigated.
         Note that this option requires that IQUICK = 0 for that
         load set which is selected by the user. Also, the KOITER
         branch MUST be entered. (IIKOIT=1)

      4  means that margins will be calculated for all design
         variables fixed except one user-selected variable. Margins
         will be calculated for a sequence of designs in which the
         user-selected variable is incremented from a user-selected
         starting value to a user-selected ending value.

      5  means that margins and interaction curves will be calculated
         for a user-selected in-plane load combination:
             (N1,N2) = (Nx,Ny) or (Nx,Nxy) or (Ny,Nxy)
         for a user-selected number of values of N1 and N2.

501.1 Any deformed panel module cross sections to be plotted?
501.2
      If ITYPE = 3 (simulation of test of panel under monotonically
      increasing load), you can get plots of the panel module
      skin-stringer cross section for load steps you select.

      You are allowed up to six load steps for each execution
      of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT. All panel modules chosen are plotted on
      the same frame. You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
      again, choosing different load steps, so don't worry about not
      being able to get the plots you want. One of the six load
      steps should always be the zeroth load step (undeformed
      module) so thay you have a good reference for the deformations.

502.1 Choose a load step for which to plot the panel module
502.2 
      Choose a number from the left-hand side of the screen.

      NOTE:  0 corresponds to the undeformed cross section.
               It is a good idea always to include 0 so the
               deformed panel modules for non-zero loads
               have a reference. 

      You are allowed up to six load steps for each execution
      of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT. All panel modules chosen are plotted on
      the same frame. You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
      again, choosing different load steps, so don't worry about not
      being able to get the plots you want. One of the six load
      steps should always be the zeroth load step (undeformed
      module) so thay you have a good reference for the deformations.

503.1 Any behaviors to be plotted v. load steps (Y or N)?
503.2 
      If ITYPE = 3 (simulation of test of panel under monotonically
      increasing load), you can get plots of various behaviors v.
      load step number. Behaviors include: load factor for local
      buckling of panel skin, average strains in panel, average
      loads in each segment of the panel module, bowing amplitude,
      axial, hoop, and shear tangent stiffnesses, maximum normal
      deflection midway between stringers, etc.

      You are allowed up to ten behaviors for each execution
      of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT. All behaviors chosen are plotted on
      the same frame, so choose behaviors with similar orders of
      magnitude in a given run.  You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
      again, choosing different behaviors, so don't worry about not
      being able to get the plots you want.

504.1 Choose a behavior to be plotted v. load steps
504.2 
      Choose a number from the left-hand side of the screen.

      You are allowed up to ten behaviors for each execution
      of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT. All behaviors chosen are plotted on
      the same frame, so choose behaviors with similar orders of
      magnitude in a given run.  You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
      again, choosing different behaviors, so don't worry about not
      being able to get the plots you want.

505.0
      Next you will be asked if you want to "use default for thickness
      decision variables". This is sometimes best if you have a lot
      of different layer types. However, it is a bit tricky and you
      must be careful.  You answer Y or N.  Your answer means:
       N   means you choose thickness decision variables one-by-one.
       Y   means that for a certain range of layer index types, to be
           specified by you, the following will happen:
          1. the thickness of any layer type for which the winding
             angle is either 0 or 90 deg. will be a decision variable.
          2. the thickness of any layer type will be a decision
             variable, regardless of winding angle, if the winding
             angle of any previous layer type within the given range
             of layer types is not equal to minus the winding angle
             of the current layer type.
          3. If the current winding angle is minus some previous
             winding angle within the given range of layer types,
             the current thickness will be linked to that previous
             thickness, and the linking constant C will be 1.0.
      NOTE: You must choose lowest and highest layer indeces from a
            GIVEN SEGMENT in the module cross section, NOT from the
            entire module, and a skin-stringer module must be done
            separately from a skin-ring module. You MUST answer N
            if winding angles are decision variables.

506.1 Want to use default for thickness decision variables (type H(elp)?
506.2 
      It is sometimes best to answer Y if you have a lot of different
      layer types. However, it is a bit tricky and YOU MUST BE CAREFUL.
      You answer Y or N.  Your answer means:
       N   means you choose thickness decision variables one-by-one.
       Y   means that for a certain range of layer index types, to be
           specified by you, the following will happen:
          1. the thickness of any layer type for which the winding
             angle is either 0 or 90 deg. will be a decision variable.
          2. the thickness of any layer type will be a decision
             variable, regardless of winding angle, if the winding
             angle of any previous layer type within the given range
             of layer types is not equal to minus the winding angle
             of the current layer type.
          3. If the current winding angle is minus some previous
             winding angle within the given range of layer types,
             the current thickness will be linked to that previous
             thickness, and the linking constant C will be 1.0.
      NOTE: You must choose lowest and highest layer indeces from a
            GIVEN SEGMENT in the module cross section, NOT from the
            entire module, and a skin-stringer module must be done
            separately from a skin-ring module. You MUST answer N
            if winding angles are decision variables.

507.1 Lowest layer index (r.h.screen) for default decision variable
507.2 
      Choose a layer index number, NOT a variable number!

      You are now specifying a range of layer indices for which you
      want PANDA2 to set up the decision variables. (These decision
      variables will be thicknesses only, not winding angles.) What
      is wanted now is the lowest layer index number for which you
      want PANDA2 to establish decision variables.

      NOTE: choose lowest and highest layer indeces from a GIVEN
            SEGMENT in the module cross section, NOT from the entire
            module!

508.1 Highest layer index for default decision variable
508.2
      Choose a layer index number, NOT a variable number!
      What is wanted now is the highest layer index number for which
      you want PANDA2 to establish decision variables.

      NOTE: choose lowest and highest layer indeces from a GIVEN
            SEGMENT in the module cross section, NOT from the entire
            module!

509.1 Upper bound of any layer thickness in the chosen range, TMAX
509.2
      You may not want to stack too many identical plies together.
      An upper limit of 5 or 6 plies may be advisable.

510.1 Any more ranges of layer types for default dec. var.?
510.2 
      Are there other ranges of layer index numbers for which you
      want PANDA2 to decide about which thicknesses are decision
      variables?

      NOTE: Since you must choose lowest and highest layer indeces
            from a GIVEN SEGMENT in the module cross section, and
            NOT from the entire module, you may need to choose
            default thicknesses corresponding to each of several
            segments within the panel module cross section.

511.1 Choose a decision variable (1,2,3,...)
511.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the table above.

512.1 Any design variables to be plotted v. iterations (Y or N)?
512.2 
      Usually you answer Y. However, you may have plotted all
      the design parameters you want, and still have more design
      margins to plot.  The plots will show the design variables you
      next choose versus design iterations from the beginning of the
      case, or from when you reset ITRTOT to zero, through the
      iteration most recently completed. 

513.1 Choose a variable to be plotted v. iterations (1,2,3,..)
513.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the table above.

514.1 Any design margins to be plotted (Y or N)?
514.2 
      Usually you answer Y. However, you may have plotted all
      the design margins you want, and still have more design
      variables to plot.  If ITYPE=1 (optimization) the plots
      will show the design margins you next choose versus design
      iterations from the beginning of the case, or from when
      you last reset ITRTOT to zero, through the iteration most
      recently completed. If ITYPE=3 (load incrementation for a
      given design) the plots will show the design margins you
      next choose versus load step number.  A table of load v.
      load step number appears in the NAME.OPI file.

515.1 For which load set (1 - 5) do you want behavior/margins?
515.2 
      Must be an integer from 1 through 5, since a maximum of five
      load sets are permitted in PANDA2.  Each time you give the
      commands CHOOSEPLOT and DIPLOT you are allowed to choose only
      one load set for which to plot behavior and/or margins. You
      can give the commands CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT as many times as you
      wish, so that you can obtain plots corresponding to all behaviors
      and/or margins for a given load set, for all load sets.

516.1 Choose a sub-case (1 or 2) within this load set
516.2 
      Must be either 1 or 2, since only two sub-cases per load set
      are possible in PANDA2:
 
        1  Sub-case 1 corresponds to conditions at the MIDLENGTH of
           the panel (or, if there are rings, at MIDWAY between rings);

        2  Sub-case 2 corresponds to conditions at the PANEL ENDS
           (or, if there are rings, where the ring web intersects
            the panel skin).

      Often results have been obtained only for the panel MIDLENGTH,
      so that often you will enter  1  here.  If the panel is
      clamped in the prebuckling phase, and if you have normal
      pressure on it for the load case you have just chosen, there
      will be two sub-cases for this load case.  If the panel is
      curved there will usually be two subcases. You can tell how
      many sub-cases there are for a given load set by inspecting
      the NAME.OPM file. Each time you give the commands CHOOSEPLOT
      and DIPLOT you are allowed to choose only one sub-case for
      which to plot margins. You can give the commands CHOOSEPLOT
      and DIPLOT as many times as you wish, so that you obtain
      plots corresponding to both sub-cases within the load set.

517.1 Choose a margin to be plotted v. iterations (1,2,3,..)
517.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the table above.

518.1 Any extreme fiber strains to be plotted v. load steps?
518.2 
      If ITYPE = 3 (simulation of test of panel under monotonically
      increasing load), you can get plots of extreme fiber axial,
      hoop, and in-plane shear strains at various locations on the
      single panel module v. load step number. These plots are very
      useful because they afford a direct comparison between PANDA2
      results and test results.

      You are allowed to choose up to five strain locations for each
      execution of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT.  Extreme fiber axial strains
      at the chosen locations are plotted on one frame; extreme fiber
      hoop strains at the same locations are plotted on the next
      frame; extreme fiber in-plane shear strains at the same
      locations are plotted on the next frame.

      You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT again, choosing different
      locations, so don't worry about not being able to get the plots
      you want.

519.1 Choose a location (1, 2, ...) for strain plots
519.2 
      Choose a number from the sketch above.

520.1 Lower bound of variable no.
522.0 
      Next, you will be asked if you want to establish a lower bound
      for the thickness of each ply in the range of layer indices for
      which you are letting PANDA2 choose decision variables. If you
      answer N, PANDA2 will set the lower bound equal to 0.01 times
      the current thickness. PANDA2 may then automatically drop plies
      that become less than 0.25 times the ply thickness. If you
      answer Y, then you will be asked to provide the lower bound. In
      this case you may want to choose the lower bound to be equal to
      the ply thickness.  Note that if you do this, PANDA2 will never
      drop any of the plies in the range of layer indices for which
      you have just said that you want PANDA2 to establish decision
      variables by default. 

523.1 Do you want to set the lower bound on layer thickness?
523.2 
      NOTE: The same lower bound will be set for the thickness of
            each layer in the range of layer indices for which you
            have just indicated that you want PANDA2 to select
            decision variables by default.

524.1 Lower bound of the thickness of each layer in the range
524.2 
      It may be a good idea to set the lower bound equal to the
      thickness of a single ply. Note that if you do this, PANDA2
      will never drop the ply, even though it may not be needed.

525.1 Choose (axial,hoop) or (+45deg,-45deg) strain plots (1 or 2)
525.2 
      Type  1  if you want plots of extreme fiber axial, hoop,
               and in-plane shear strains.

      Type  2  if you want plots of extreme fiber normal and shear
               strains oriented at + and - 45 degrees from the
               axial direction. (to correlate with 45-degree
               strain gages readings from an experiment, for example).

530.1 Upper bound of variable no.
540.1 Any more decision variables (Y or N) ?
541.1 Any more load steps for which to plot panel module (Y/N)?
541.2 
      You are allowed up to six load steps for each execution
      of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT. All panel modules chosen are plotted on
      the same frame. You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
      again, choosing different load steps, so don't worry about not
      being able to get the plots you want. One of the six load
      steps should always be the zeroth load step (undeformed
      module) so thay you have a good reference for the deformations.

542.1 Any more behaviors to be plotted v. load steps (Y/N)?
542.2 
      You are allowed up to ten behaviors for each execution
      of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT. All behaviors chosen are plotted on
      the same frame, so choose behaviors with similar orders of
      magnitude in a given run.  You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
      again, choosing different behaviors, so don't worry about not
      being able to get the plots you want.

543.1 Any more locations for plotting v. load steps (Y/N)?
543.2 
      You are allowed to choose up to five strain locations for each
      execution of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT.  Extreme fiber axial strains
      at the chosen locations are plotted on one frame; extreme fiber
      hoop strains at the same locations are plotted on the next
      frame; extreme fiber in-plane shear strains at the same
      locations are plotted on the next frame.

      You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT again, choosing different
      locations, so don't worry about not being able to get the plots
      you want.

544.1 Any more design variables to be plotted (Y or N) ?
544.2 
      You are allowed up to ten design variables for each execution
      of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT. All design variables chosen are plotted on
      the same frame, so choose design variables with similar orders of
      magnitude in a given run.  You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
      again, choosing different design variables, so don't worry about
      not being able to get the plots you want.

545.1 Any more margins to be plotted (Y or N) ?
545.2 
      You are allowed up to ten margins for each execution
      of CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT. All margins chosen are plotted on
      the same frame, so choose margins with similar orders of
      magnitude in a given run.  You can always run CHOOSEPLOT/DIPLOT
      again, choosing different margins, so don't worry about not
      being able to get the plots you want.

547.1 Give maximum value (positive) to be included in plot frame.
547.2 
      Margins can vary widely. In order to prevent scaling problems
      in the plots, it is best to limit the magnitude of the maximum
      number to be included in the plot frame. 1 - 5 is a good number
      to use here. You might use a number such as 0.1 or 0.2 if many
      margins are clustered near zero and you want to see each of
      them more clearly on the plots.

548.0
      Next, choose linked variables.
 
      A linked variable is a variable that is not a decision
      variable, but is expressed in terms of decision variables,
      thus:
   
       (linked variable)  =  C1*(decision variable no. j1)
                            +C2*(decision variable no. j2)
                            +C3*(decision variable no. j3)
                            +etc (up to max. of 5 terms)
                            +C0
 
       in which C1, C2,..;  and C0 are constants.

      For example, material layers with
      + ALPHA degree orientation are usually matched with layers with
      - ALPHA degree orientation. Suppose for a certain layer with 
      winding angle + ALPHA, this winding angle is chosen as a
      decision variable.  You want another layer in the same
      laminate to have the winding angle - ALPHA.  Then, for this
      other layer:

       (winding angle) = -1.0*(winding angle of the layer with +ALPHA)

      The winding angle on the left-hand-side of the above
      equation is called a linked variable because its value
      is linked to that of the first mentioned layer. The linking
      constant C1 = -1.0 in this example.
 
550.1 Any linked variables (Y or N) ?
550.2  
      A linked variable is a variable that is not a decision
      variable, but is expressed in terms of decision variables,
      thus:
   
       (linked variable)  =  C1*(decision variable no. j1)
                            +C2*(decision variable no. j2)
                            +C3*(decision variable no. j3)
                            +etc (up to max. of 5 terms)
                            +C0
 
       in which C1, C2,..;  and C0 are constants.

      For example, material layers with
      + ALPHA degree orientation are usually matched with layers with
      - ALPHA degree orientation. Suppose for a certain layer with 
      winding angle + ALPHA, this winding angle is chosen as a
      decision variable.  You want another layer in the same
      laminate to have the winding angle - ALPHA.  Then, for this
      other layer:

       (winding angle) = -1.0*(winding angle of the layer with +ALPHA)

      The winding angle on the left-hand-side of the above
      equation is called a linked variable because its value
      is linked to that of the first mentioned layer. The linking
      constant C1 = -1.0 in this example.

560.1 Choose a linked variable (1,2,3,...)
560.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the table above.
 
570.1 To which variable is this variable linked?
570.2 
      Pick an index from the left-hand column of the table above.
 
580.1 Assign a value to the linking coefficient, C(j)
580.2  
      A linked variable is a variable that is not a decision
      variable, but is expressed in terms of decision variables,
      thus:
   
       (linked variable)  =  C1*(decision variable no. j1)
                            +C2*(decision variable no. j2)
                            +C3*(decision variable no. j3)
                            +etc (up to max. of 5 terms)
                            +C0
 
       in which C1, C2,..;  and C0 are constants.
 
584.1 To what power is the decision variable raised?
584.2
      What is the value of D(j)?
  
587.1 Any other decision variables in the linking expression?
587.2 
      A general expression for a linked variable has the form:
   
       (linked variable)  =  C1*(decision variable no. j1)
                            +C2*(decision variable no. j2)
                            +C3*(decision variable no. j3)
                            +etc (up to max. of 5 terms)
                            +C0
 
       in which C1, C2,..;  and C0 are constants.

588.1 Any constant C0 in the linking expression (Y or N)?
588.2 
      A general expression for a linked variable has the form:
   
       (linked variable)  =  C1*(decision variable no. j1)
                            +C2*(decision variable no. j2)
                            +C3*(decision variable no. j3)
                            +etc (up to max. of 5 terms)
                            +C0
 
       in which C1, C2,..;  and C0 are constants.

589.1 Give the value of C0 in the linking expression. C0
589.2 
      A general expression for a linked variable has the form:
   
       (linked variable)  =  C1*(decision variable no. j1)
                            +C2*(decision variable no. j2)
                            +C3*(decision variable no. j3)
                            +etc (up to max. of 5 terms)
                            +C0
 
       in which C1, C2,..;  and C0 are constants.

590.1 Any more linked variables (Y or N) ?
595.0 
      Next, establish inequality relations among variables
      of the two forms:

       1.0 < f(v1,v2,v3,...)    or   1.0 > f(v1,v2,v3,...) 
 
      in which the expression f(v1,v2,v3,...) has the form:
 
        f(v1,v2,v3,...) = C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +C3*v3**D3 + ...
                             +etc (up to max. of 10 terms).
                             + up to 10 cross product terms of the form
                               C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)
 
      The variables, v1, v2, v3,..., can be any of the variables
      that are decision variables or potential candidates for
      decision variables or linked variables.
 
600.1 Any inequality relations among variables? (type H)
600.2 
      You may want to impose lower and upper bounds on linked
      variables, or you may want to force certain expressions
      involving combinations of variables to be larger than or
      less than certain values.  For example, you may want to
      force the height of a stiffener segment to be no more than
      15 times its total thickness. Or you may want the length
      of a plate always to be greater than 1.5 times its width.
      
      The inequality relations have either of the two forms:
       1.0 < f(v1,v2,v3,...)    or   1.0 > f(v1,v2,v3,...) 
      in which the expression f(v1,v2,v3,...) has the form:
        f(v1,v2,v3,...) = C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +C3*v3**D3 + ...
                             +etc (up to max. of 10 terms).
                             + up to 10 cross product terms of the form
                               C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)
      The variables, v1, v2, v3,..., can be any of the variables
      that are decision variables or potential candidates for
      decision variables or linked variables.
 
601.1 Want to see an example of how to calculate C0, C1, D1,..?
602.0
      For example, suppose that you want to impose the condition
      that the area of a rectangular plate be greater than 50.
      Let v1 = length of plate;  v2 = width of plate. You want
           v1*v2 > 50                              (1)
      The expression (1) must be expressed in the form
             1.0 > C0 + C1*v1**D1 + C2*v2**D2      (2)
      If we: (a) divide both sides of (1) by v2 (assume v2 is positive!);
             (b) subtract v1 from both sides of (1); and
             (c) add 1.0 to both sides of (1), we obtain
                   1.0 > 1.0 -v1 +50/v2            (3)
      From (3) we easily deduce that in (2): C0 = 1.0; C1 = -1.0;
      D1 = 1.0; C2 = 50; and D2 = -1.0.  Eq.(3) represents the
      second type of expression given above. The actual value of
      the constraint, CONSTR, used later by the optimizer would be
                 CONSTR = 2. - (1.0 -v1 +50/v2).
      This constraint is critical if its value is less than 1.0.
      (NOTE: THIS IS A POOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE NOW CROSS PRODUCT TERMS
             ARE PERMITTED AS OF JANUARY, 1997)

603.1 Identify the type of inequality expression (1 or 2)
603.2 
      The inequality relations have either of the two forms:

          Type 1 is:     1.0 < f(v1,v2,v3,...) 

          Type 2 is:     1.0 > f(v1,v2,v3,...) 

      in which the expression f(v1,v2,v3,...) has the form:

        f(v1,v2,v3,...) = C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +C3*v3**D3 + ...
                             +etc (up to max. of 10 terms).
                             + up to 10 cross product terms of the form
                               C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)

604.0
      Now start building the expression: C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...      
      You are allowed up to 10 terms in the expression, including C0.
 
605.1 Give a value to the constant, C0
605.2 
      The inequality relations have either of the two forms:

       1.0 < f(v1,v2,v3,...)    or   1.0 > f(v1,v2,v3,...) 

      in which the expression f(v1,v2,v3,...) has the form:

        f(v1,v2,v3,...) = C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +C3*v3**D3 + ...
                             +etc (up to max. of 10 terms).
                             + up to 10 cross product terms of the form
                               C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)

      The variables, v1, v2, v3,..., can be any of the variables
      that are decision variables or potential candidates for
      decision variables or linked variables.

606.1 Are there any cross product terms in the inequality expression?
606.2 
      Generally answer "N" if there are no terms of the form

                  C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j),  i not equal to j

      in the inequality expression. However, note that if you need more
      than a total of 10 terms to include the C0 term plus all linear
      terms plus all terms of the type C(n)*v(n)**2, which you are asked
      to supply next, then you can "fake it" by answering "Y" to this
      question. Subsequently, you can then supply the additional "squared"
      terms in the section of this input meant for cross product terms,
      in addition to any actual cross product terms.

      You are allowed a maximum of 10 terms in the first part of the
      inequality expression, that is, in the part of the inequality
      expression that has the form: C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...

607.1 Are there any terms of the form Cn*vn**Dn?
607.2 
      For example, are there any linear or "squared" terms in the
      inequality expression? The answer is almost always "Y".

608.1 Choose a variable from the list above (1, 2, 3,...)
608.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the list above.
  
610.1 Choose a value for the coefficient, C1
610.2
      You are building the expression: C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...

620.1 Choose a value for the power, D1
620.2 
      You are building the expression: C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...

630.1 Any more terms in the expression: C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...
630.2
      You are allowed up to 10 terms in the expression, including C0.

635.1 Choose a variable from the list above (1, 2, 3,...)
635.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the list above.
  
640.1 Choose a value for the coefficient, Cn
640.2
      You are building the expression: C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...
      You are allowed up to 10 terms in the expression, including C0.

645.1 Choose a value for the power, Dn
645.2 
      You are building the expression: C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...
      You are allowed up to 10 terms in the expression, including C0.

649.0 
      You have previously indicated that there are cross product terms
      in the inequality expression. The cross product terms must all
      have the following form:

                  C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)

      in which C(i,j) is a coefficient, v(i) is the ith variable, and
      v(j) is the jth variable. NOTE: you can use this part of DECIDE
      to add more "squared" terms in addition to cross-product terms
      if you need to do so.

      You are allowed a maximum of 10 cross product terms in the
      inequality expression.

651.1 Do you want to add any more "cross product" terms?
651.2 
      You are building the expression:
            Sum-over-i-and-j [C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)].
      You are allowed up to 10 terms in the "cross-product" expression.
      During computation of the inequality constraint in SUBROUTINE
      VARCON (located in the STRUCT library) the "cross-product"
      expression:
            Sum-over-i-and-j [C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)].
      is added to your previously built-up expression:
            C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...

652.1 Choose the first variable,  v(i), from the above list
652.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the list above.
      
654.1 Choose the second variable, v(j), from the above list
654.2 
      Use an index from the left-hand column of the list above.
      NOTE: usually j will not equal i. However, you are not
      prevented from generating more "squared" terms in the
      inequality expression at this point if you really want to
      do so.
      
656.1 Choose a value for the coefficient, C(i,j)
656.2 
      You are building the expression:
            Sum-over-i-and-j [C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)].
      You are allowed up to 10 terms in the expression. During
      computation of the inequality constraint in SUBROUTINE VARCON
      (located in the STRUCT library) the "cross-product" expression:
            Sum-over-i-and-j [C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)].
      is added to your previously built-up expression:
            C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +...

660.1 Are there any more inequality expressions?
660.2 
      The inequality relations have either of the two forms:

       1.0 < f(v1,v2,v3,...)    or   1.0 > f(v1,v2,v3,...) 

      in which the expression f(v1,v2,v3,...) has the form:

        f(v1,v2,v3,...) = C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +C3*v3**D3 + ...
                             +etc (up to max. of 10 terms).
                             + up to 10 cross product terms of the form
                               C(i,j)*v(i)*v(j)

      The variables, v1, v2, v3,..., can be any of the variables
      that are decision variables or potential candidates for
      decision variables or linked variables.

680.1 Any escape variables (Y or N) ?
680.2 
      An escape variable is a variable that when increased 
      drives the design toward the feasible region. For example, in
      designs which are buckling-critical, local and general
      instability represent two constraint conditions that bound the
      feasible region. Increasing the thicknesses of any parts while
      keeping all other dimensions the same drives the design toward
      the feasible region (makes buckling less critical). Hence, a
      thickness should always be chosen as an escape variable. Other
      variables, such as winding angles, should  not be used
      as escape variables, since their increase might well result in
      a decrease in the buckling load, hence driving the design toward
      the infeasible region.

682.1 Want to have escape variables chosen by default?
682.2 
      Generally answer Y.  PANDA2 will then automatically choose
      as escape variables all of the thicknesses that are decision
      variables. This is usually the best strategy and use of the
      default option saves you the trouble of doing it interactively.

685.1 Choose an escape variable (1, 2, 3, . . .)
685.2  
      An escape variable is a variable that when increased drives the
      drives the design toward the feasible region. For example, in
      designs which are buckling-critical, local and general
      instability represent two constraint conditions that bound the
      feasible region. Increasing the thicknesses of any parts while
      keeping all other dimensions the same drives the design toward
      the feasible region (makes buckling less critical). Hence, a
      thickness should always be chosen as an escape variable. Other
      variables, such as winding angles, should probably not be used
      as escape variables, since their increase might well result in
      a decrease in the buckling load, hence driving the design toward
      the infeasible region.

687.1 Any more escape variables (Y or N) ?

689.1 Choose BOSOR4 model: INDIC=1 or INDIC=4; INDIC
689.2 
      Ordinarily you should choose INDIC = 1

      INDIC = 1 means that you supply the loads and BOSOR4
                derives the prebuckled state and buckling load.
                This option ignores any thermal loading, but
                permits loads in Load Set A and Load Set B. You
                cannot use this branch if you want to compare results
                with PANDA2 for a globally imperfect panel.

      INDIC = 4 means that BOSOR4 computes only the buckling load.
                The prebuckled state is given. This option does
                not permit Load Set A and Load Set B. The prebuckled
                state is that from the combined Load Set A and
                Load Set B as derived in PANDA2, but all loading is
                considered to be in Load Set A. Thermal loads are
                included.

690.0  
      Next, you will be asked to provide the loads in Load Set A
      and Load Set B to be used as input for the BOSOR4 model of
      the multi-module discretized skin-smeared-stringer-ring model.
      The following loads will be asked for for each of the two
      load sets (Load Set A = "eigenvalue" loads; Load Set B = loads
      that are not multiplied by the eigenvalue. That is, the total
      load at buckling = (Load Set B) + lambda*(Load Set A), in which
      lambda is the eigenvalue: the buckling load factor. You must
      supply the following input data
      1. axial resultant in Load Set A, Nx   (positive for tension)
      2. axial resultant in Load Set B, Nxo  (positive for tension)
      3. normal pressure, p                  (positive for internal)
      4. a control integer, IABP = 0 for pressure in Load Set B
                            IABP = 1 for pressure in Load Set A
      
      NOTE: This automated multi-module model does not account for
            thermal loading.

692.1 Axial resultant Nx in Load Set A, Nx
692.2 
      Positive for axial tension, negative for compression.

694.1 Axial resultant Nxo in Load Set B, Nxo
694.2 
      Positive for axial tension, negative for compression.

696.1 Normal pressure p
696.2 
      Positive for internal pressure, negative for external pressure.

698.1 IABP = 1 if pressure in Load Set A; IABP=0 otherwise. IABP
698.2 
      Please supply IABP = 1 or IABP = 0

700.0 
      This section pertains to STAGS models generated via STAGSUNIT.
      You will next be asked if you want stringer(s) and/or ring(s)
      to have a denser finite element mesh than all the others
      in the STAGS model. Ordinarily you should answer N (no).
      First, you will be asked with regard to stringers, then
      with regard to rings. For each category (stringers, rings),
      if you answer Y, you will next be asked to give the stringer
      number(s) or ring number(s) which are to have the higher nodal
      point density. The stringers are numbered from the bottom to
      the top (or right to left). The rings are numbered from
      the bottom to the top (or left to right). See Fig. 2 of
      the paper, "Difficulties in optimization...", AIAA Paper No.
      2006-1943, AIAA SDM Meeting, Newport, RI, May 2006, for an
      example of a STAGS model produced by STAGSUNIT. Stringer
      numbers increase with coordinate y; ring numbers increase
      with coordinate x.

701.1 Do you want stringer(s) with a high nodal point density?
701.2 
      The "nodal point density" referred to is with respect to
      the stringer cross section, not the density along the axis
      of the stringer. The density along the axis of the
      stringer is the same as the density along the x-coordinate
      in the panel skin.

      You may wamt one or more stringers with a higher nodal
      point density over the cross section than exists in the
      others, especially if there occurs local stress and/or
      buckling behavior not well represented by your previously
      specified nodal point distribution over the cross section
      used for all the stringers in your previous model.

702.1 Number of a stringer to have high mesh density, NUMSTR
702.2 
      Stringer number increases with increasing coordinate y.
      See Fig. 2 of AIAA Paper No. 2006-1943 for an example.

      Choose a stringer that you expect to experience high 
      axial loading and therefore high stress and low
      buckling load factor. Or choose a stringer for which
      a previous model displayed significant local deformation
      and/or locally high stress not well represented by
      your previous nodal point distribution over its cross
      section.

703.1 Do you want to choose another stringer?
703.2 
      You can choose up to 50 stringers. Don't overdo it.
     
704.1 Do you want ring(s) with a high nodal point density?
704.2
      The "nodal point density" referred to is with respect to
      the ring cross section, not the density along the axis
      of the ring. The density along the axis of the
      ring is the same as the density along the y-coordinate
      in the panel skin.

      You may wamt one or more rings with a higher nodal
      point density over the cross section than exists in the
      others, especially if there occurs local stress and/or
      buckling behavior not well represented by your previously
      specified nodal point distribution over the cross section
      used for all the rings in your previous model.

705.1 Number of a ring to have high mesh density, NUMRNG
705.2
      Ring number increases with increasing coordinate x.
      See Fig. 2 of AIAA Paper No. 2006-1943 for an example.

      Choose a ring that you expect to experience high
      axial loading and therefore high stress and low
      buckling load factor. Or choose a ring for which
      a previous model displayed significant local deformation
      and/or locally high stress not well represented by
      your previous nodal point distribution over its cross
      section.

706.1 Do you want to choose another ring?
706.2
      You can choose up to 50 rings. Don't overdo it.

708.1 Choose ICONSV = -1 or 0 or 1 or H(elp), ICONSV
708.2 
      Please use ICONSV = 1 as the preferred choice.

      ICONSV = 1 (recommended model) means:
        a. Include ARBOCZ theory when computing knockdown
           factors for local, inter-ring, general buckling.

        b. Use more conservative knockdown factors for models
           in which the stringers are smeared.

        c. Use computed knockdown factor for smearing rings

        d. The Donnell shell theory is used in SUBROUTINE STRIMP,
           where imperfection sensitivity is being computed.

        e. Will use the non-zero slope of buckling nodal lines
           in the computation of prebuckling bending and
           twisting, Wxx, Wyy, Wxy, of shells with general,
           inter-ring, and local buckling modal imperfections.
           (panda2.news Items 620 and 645 are cancelled).

      ICONSV = 0 (less conservative model) means:
        a. Do NOT include ARBOCZ theory when computing knockdown
           factors for local, inter-ring, general buckling.

        b. Use less conservative knockdown factors for models
           in which the stringers are smeared.

        c. Use computed knockdown factor for smearing rings
           (Same as for ICONSV = 1).

        d. The user-selected shell theory is used in SUBROUTINE
           STRIMP, where imperfection sensitivity is being
           computed.

        e. panda2.news Items 620 and 645 are cancelled. (Same
           as for e. under ICONSV = 1).

      ICONSV = -1 (still less conservative model) means:
        a. Do NOT include ARBOCZ theory when computing knockdown
           factors for local, inter-ring, general buckling.
           (Same as for ICONSV = 0)

        b. Use less conservative knockdown factors for models
           in which the stringers are smeared.
           (Same as for ICONSV = 0)

        c. Do NOT use computed knockdown factor for smearing rings
           (Knockdown factor for smearing rings = 1.0 EXCEPT when
            there exists significant local deformation in the
            outstanding flange of the ring in the "skin"-ring
            single discretized module general buckling model,
            in which case the knockdown factor is computed in
            the same way as for ICONSV = 1 and ICONSV = 0).

        d. Set the knockdown factor for truncated double-trig
           series expansion (altsol) models to RFACT = 0.95. 
           (RFACT=0.85 for "altsol" models in which there are
            smeared stiffeners if ICONSV = 0 or 1).

        e. The user-selected shell theory is used in SUBROUTINE
           STRIMP, where imperfection sensitivity is being
           computed.

        f. panda2.news Items 620 and 645 are in force, that is,
           a non-zero slope of buckling nodal lines will
           probably be set to zero for the computation of Wxx,
           Wyy, and Wxy. (Different from e. under ICONSV = 0 and
           ICONSV = 1).

        g. panda2.news Item 741 is in force, that is, the
           "effective" buckling load for the imperfect shell is
           given by:

                  FMULT2 = 1.0
                  IF (ICONSV.EQ.-1) FMULT2 = 10.0
                  EIGEFF =(FACIM1*EILOC9 +FACIM2*FMULT2*EILC91)/
                                          (FACIM1+FMULT2*FACIM2)
           for general buckling, and

                  FMULT2 = 1.0
                  IF (ICONSV.EQ.-1) FMULT2 = 10.0
                  EIGEFF =(FACIM1*EILOC8 +FACIM2*FMULT2*EILC81)/
                                          (FACIM1+FMULT2*FACIM2)
           for inter-ring buckling, and

                  FMULT2 = 1.0
                  IF (ICONSV.EQ.-1) FMULT2 = 10.0
                  EIGEFF =(FACIM1*EILOC7 +FACIM2*FMULT2*EILC71)/
                                          (FACIM1+FMULT2*FACIM2)
           for local buckling, in which
           EILOC9, EILOC8, EILOC7 are buckling load factors for
           the imperfect shell, and EILOC91, EILOC81, EILOC71
           are buckling load factors for the perfect shell. The
           factors, FACIM1 and FACIM2, are given by:

           FACIM1=1./(EILOC9 - 1.) and FACIM2=1./(EILOC91 - 1.)
           for general buckling,

           FACIM1=1./(EILOC8 - 1.) and FACIM2=1./(EILOC81 - 1.)
           for inter-ring buckling, and

           FACIM1=1./(EILOC7 - 1.) and FACIM2=1./(EILOC71 - 1.)
           for local buckling.

710.1 Do you want to impose rv=0 along the two curved edges?
710.2 
      "rv" means rotation about v-direction, that is,
      "meridional rotation" in BOSOR jargon. Your answer
      should almost always be N (no). Occasionally
      there exists an axisymmetric collapse mode for which
      the largest normal displacement w and rotation rv
      exist along the two curved edges of a cylindrical
      shell or panel. The load associated with this
      mode of collapse is occasionally significantly
      lower than the design load. In an actual cylindrical
      shell this mode would not exist because of constraint
      along the two curved edges. The STAGSUNIT processor
      does not prevent this mode of failure because the
      boundary conditions along the two curved edges are
      specified in such a way that:

      1. Uniform normal displacement w is permitted so
         that local edge buckling will not occur due to
         stress concentrations near the curved edges
         generated by the Poisson effect, and

      2. The rotation rv is free to occur in order to
         simulate simple support along the two curved
         edges, which the PANDA2 model is based on.

      These two characteristics of the STAGS model are
      needed in order to check optimum designs generated
      with PANDA2. Also, they are needed in order to
      be able to check PANDA2 local buckling phenomena
      through the use of sub-domain STAGS models generated
      with STAGSUNIT.

      If you answer Y (yes), then your STAGS model may
      well be unacceptably unconservative compared to
      the PANDA2 model. Only answer Y (yes) if early local
      axisymmetric collapse near the curved edges prevents
      determination of behavior for loads up to the design load.

      NOTE: If you answer Y the rotation rv is constrained
      to be zero only for nonlinear static and dynamic
      analyses, not for linear bifurcation buckling analyses.

715.1 Do you want to vary M for minimum local buckling load?
715.2 
      M is the number of axial half-waves between rings
      in the local buckling mode.

      The developer of PANDA2 always answers "Y". Don't
      worry about computer time, as described below. That
      paragraph was written many years ago when computers
      were much slower.

      Computer time can be saved if you are confident that
      the number of axial halfwaves M that you next choose is
      truly the critical value for local skin buckling. Generally
      answer this question Y.  Note, however, that there may
      be cases when you will want to do preliminary optimization
      runs in which M is fixed at a value that you know is near
      the critical value for plates with aspect ratios fairly
      close to that of your current design. In this way you can
      save a lot of computer time and perhaps come up with a
      good preliminary optimum design. You can always later allow
      M to vary, thereby checking your intuition and further
      improving the design.

720.1 Do you want to choose a starting M for local buckling?
720.2 
      M is the number of axial halfwaves between rings, or if there
      are no rings, along the entire axial length of the panel. If
      you answer N for "no", PANDA2 starts with M calculated
      from the formula:

       M = SQRT(C(5,5)/C(4,4))*(axial length of panel between rings)/
           (stringer spacing - stringer base width) + 2

      which is based on experimental observations that local buckles
      of uniformly axially compressed long, narrow, isotropic
      plates are almost square.

      However, from previous experience on this and other similar
      cases, you may wish to use a different starting value for M.
      Generally answer this question N for "no".

725.1 Do you want to vary axial waves M for minimum buckling load?
725.2 
      Computer time can be saved if you are confident that
      the number of axial halfwaves M that you next choose is
      truly the critical value for local skin buckling. General
      answer this question Y.  Note, however, that there may
      be cases when you will want to do preliminary optimization
      runs in which M is fixed at a value that you know is near
      the critical value for plates with aspect ratios fairly
      close to that of your current design. In this way you can
      save a lot of computer time and perhaps come up with a
      good preliminary optimum design. You can always later allow
      M to vary, thereby checking your intuition and further
      improving the design.

728.0 
      You will be asked to "Choose the number of axial halfwaves, M"
      Note that this means the number of axial halfwaves between
      adjacent rings.

730.1 Choose the number of axial halfwaves, M
732.1 Do you want to perform a "low-axial-wavenumber" search?
732.2 
      What is being referred to here is a search over the number
      of axial halfwaves between rings to determine the critical
      local buckling load factor.  There are many panels and
      loadings for which the local buckling load factor versus the number
      of axial halfwaves has more than one minimum. If you answer
      Y, PANDA2 will search for critical local buckling load factors
      over two ranges of axial halfwaves, a high range and a low range.

      The developer of PANDA2 always answers "Y" . Don't worry about
      computer time. The next paragraph was written when computers
      were much slower.

      Generally, in order to ensure reliability, you should answer
      this question Y. However, as you gain more experience with
      PANDA2, you may occasionally want to answer N, since quite
      a bit of computer time can be saved by doing so, especially
      if you are doing optimization.  You can always do preliminary
      optimization in which you answer N (no low-wavenumber search),
      followed by more refined (and more costly) optimization runs
      in which you answer Y.

734.0
      You will next be asked to provide the maximum number
      of axial halfwaves, MMAX, that you think may possibly
      correspond to local buckling of the skin. If you are
      uncertain as to what to use, just provide a large number
      such as 1000 (fixed point).

      It is best, although certainly not critical, to use a number
      that you think is less than the critical
      wavenumber for crippling of any stiffener parts and greater
      than the critical wavenumber for buckling of the skin between
      stiffeners.  MMAX = 4*MSKIN(cr) is a good guess for MMAX, in
      which MSKIN(cr) is your estimate of the number of waves
      that corresponds to the lowest load factor for local buckling of
      the skin between stiffeners.  A good estimate for MSKIN(cr) for
      isotropic skin is  MSKIN(cr) = a/b, in which a is the ring
      spacing and b is the stringer spacing.  Hence, MMAX = 4a/b.
      (If there are no stringers, b is the panel width. If there are
      no rings, a is the panel length.)
   
      Calculations will stop if, in searching for the minimum skin
      buckling load factor vs wavenumber, the maximum MMAX is
      exceeded. The reason PANDA2 asks you for MMAX is that it wants
      to apply the Koiter postbuckling theory only to buckling modes
      in which the skin is buckling. It does not want to apply Koiter
      to stiffener crippling modes.

735.1 Maximum possible number of axial halfwaves, MMAX
735.2  
      Use a number that you think is less than the critical
      wavenumber for crippling of any stiffener parts and greater
      than the critical wavenumber for buckling of the skin between
      stiffeners.
   
740.1 Factor of safety for general instability, FSGEN
740.2 
      You can use FSGEN = 1.0 if your applied load set corresponds
      to the ULTIMATE load condition (in constrast to LIMIT load or
      OPERATING load), and if you specify reasonable ampltiudes for
      initial imperfections, Wimpg, Wimpg1, Wimpg2, Wpan, Wloc.
        
      If you do NOT specify amplitudes for Wimpg, etc, and/or if
      the applied load is less than that corresponding to the ULTIMATE
      condition, then the factor of safety FSGEN should account for
      unknown initial imperfections and/or insufficient applied load,
      as well as for the approximate manner in which the general
      buckling load factor is calculated in PANDA2.  Panels that buckle
      locally at loads far below the design load are not particularly
      sensitive to initial imperfections. For such panels, use
                    1.1  <   FSGEN    <  2.0
      Panels designed so that local and general instability loads are
      nearly equal are somewhat sensitive to initial imperfections,
      and FSGEN should be about 1.4 even if the panel is flat.
      Axially stiffened cylinders under axial compression should
      usually have  FSGEN = 2.
      Axially compressed monocoque cylinders under axial compression
      should have FSGEN = 4  if r/t > 300; FSGEN = 2 if r/t < 100.
      Cylinders under uniform external pressure should have FSGEN = 1.4.
      Cylinders under uniform torsion (in-plane shear) should have
      FSGEN = 1.3.
      NOTE: The above are general guidelines only. For more details,
      consult the extensive NASA literature, ASME Code Case N-284,
      and run PANDA with the option to get interaction curves for
      imperfect shells. Also see COMPUTERIZED BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF
      SHELLS by David Bushnell, Nijhoff and Co., The Netherlands, 1985

      The best way to design panels with PANDA2 is to use ULTIMATE loads
      and to specify reasonable (conservative) amplitudes for the various
      components, Wimpg, Wimpg1, Wimpg2, Wpan, Wloc, of imperfections,
      then use FSGEN = 1.0.  When you have an optimum design check its
      performance by using STAGS.

      Occasionally, you may want to use FSGEN = 0.999 . You do this
      in order to prevent PANDA2 from automatically increasing FSGEN
      to 1.1, which it does if FSGEN = 1.0. For example, you might wamt
      to use FSGEN = 0.999 in a case for which you intend to compare
      results from PANDA2 with results from some other analysis.

741.1 Local buckling in-plane hoop displacement fixed (0) or free (1)?
741.2  
      This input datum refers to the boundary conditions at the
      symmetry planes at the beginning of segment 1 and at the
      end of segment NSEG in the single panel module model of local
      buckling:
 
        0 means that full symmetry conditions are imposed at these planes,
          that is, the in-plane hoop displacement is zero there as well
          as the slope of the local buckling mode.

        1 means that partial symmetry is imposed:  The in-plane hoop
          displacement is free, but the slope of the buckling mode
          is still zero.

      If you are in doubt, you should answer 0.  Allowing the in-plane
      hoop displacement component to be free at a symmetry plane is as
      of this date (May 24, 1986) a somewhat experimental procedure.

742.1 Factor of safety for panel (between rings) instability, FSPAN
742.2 
      This factor pertains to buckling between rings but with circum-
      ferential wavelengths that are long enough to cause buckling
      of at least one stringer.

      This factor should account for unknown initial imperfections
      and the approximate manner in which the general instability
      load factor is calculated in PANDA2.  Panels that buckle
      locally at loads far below the design load are not particularly
      sensitive to initial imperfections. For such panels, use
                    1.1  <   FSPAN    <  1.4
      Panels designed so that local and general instability loads are
      nearly equal are somewhat sensitive to initial imperfections,
      and FSPAN should be about 1.4 even if the panel is flat.
      Axially stiffened cylinders under axial compression should
      usually have  FSPAN = 2 (except read on about wide column model).
      Axially compressed monocoque cylinders under axial compression
      should have FSPAN = 4  if r/t > 300; FSPAN = 2 if r/t < 100.
      Cylinders under uniform external pressure should have FSPAN = 1.4.
      Cylinders under uniform torsion (in-plane shear) should have
      FSPAN = 1.3.
      If you plan to use the wide column model, you can use a smaller
      factor of safety here than would otherwise be the case. In fact,
      you can probably get away with using a factor FSPAN = 1.0.
      NOTE: The above are general guidelines only. For more details,
      consult the extensive NASA literature, ASME Code Case N-284,
      and run PANDA with the option to get interaction curves for
      imperfect shells. Also see COMPUTERIZED BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF
      SHELLS by David Bushnell, Nijhoff and Co., The Netherlands, 1985

      Occasionally, you may want to use FSPAN = 0.999 . You do this
      in order to prevent PANDA2 from automatically increasing FSPAN
      to 1.1, which it does if FSPAN = 1.0. For example, you might wamt
      to use FSPAN = 0.999 in a case for which you intend to compare
      results from PANDA2 with results from some other analysis.

745.1 Minimum load factor for local buckling (Type H for HELP), FSLOC
745.2 
      Local buckling here means buckling of the panel skin between
      adjacent stringers and rings. The factor FSLOC is NOT included
      in load factors for local buckling of stringer parts. A
      different factor, FSBSTR, governs local buckling of stringer
      parts. Factors of safety for local buckling of ring parts
      are assigned by PANDA2; you have no control over them.

      FSLOC plays a special role. If you do NOT want local buckling
      to occur (you don't want any postbuckling capability), then set
      FSLOC greater than unity (minimum of 1.1), as with FSGEN and FSPAN.
      With the IQUICK = 0 option, PANDA2 assumes the panel between
      adjacent stringers is flat, so that FSLOC = 1.1 can be used.
  
      If you want postbuckling capability, but you do not want local
      buckling to occur at less than a certain fraction of the applied
      load, then set FSLOC equal to that fraction of the load. For
      example, suppose the load set Nx, Ny, Nxy corresponds to an
      ultimate load that is 1.5 times the design load. You may not
      want local buckling to occur below a limit load that is 1.25
      times the design load. To enforce this constraint, set
      FSLOC = 1.25/1.50 = 0.8333. If you are not bothered by local
      buckling at all, set FSLOC equal to zero.

      Occasionally, you may want to use FSLOC = 0.999 . You do this
      in order to prevent PANDA2 from automatically increasing FSLOC
      to 1.1, which it does if FSLOC = 1.0. For example, you might wamt
      to use FSLOC = 0.999 in a case for which you intend to compare
      results from PANDA2 with results from some other analysis.

746.0
      You will next be asked to provide a minimum load factor, FSBSTR,
      for local buckling of the stringer parts. You should probably
      use a factor of unity.

      If you use a factor less than unity, PANDA2 may produce a
      design in which one or more of the stringer parts buckle
      locally at a load smaller than the applied load. Thus,
      local buckling of the stringer parts would be allowed in
      your design concept. USE WITH CAUTION!!!

      IF YOU PLAN TO USE A VALUE OF FSBSTR THAT IS LESS THAN UNITY,
      MAKE SURE THAT YOU FIRST READ CAREFULLY ITEMS 37, 60(c), AND 67
      IN PANDA2.NEWS.
      
      Also, read items 19 and 30 of PANDA2.NEWS. If the stiffeners
      are J or T cross sections, a factor of 1.4 is
      applied to the buckling load factor for buckling of both
      segments 3 and 4 of the stiffener together. The factor you next
      apply is in addition to this, so that the total factor is:
      F.S. = 1.4*FSBSTR.
      
747.1 Minimum load factor for stiffener buckling (Type H), FSBSTR
747.2 
      Stiffener buckling here means local buckling of the parts of
      the stiffener, with the "corners" between stiffener parts
      rotating but not displacing.

      IF YOU PLAN TO USE A VALUE OF FSBSTR THAT IS LESS THAN UNITY,
      MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ CAREFULLY ITEMS 37, 60(c) AND 67
      IN PANDA2.NEWS.

      FSBSTR plays a special role. If you do NOT want local buckling
      to occur (you don't want any postbuckling capability of the
      stiffener parts), then set FSBSTR greater than unity. (Minimum
      value of 1.1 is suggested.)

      The factor of safety for buckling of ring parts is always 1.0
      or greater. If you set FSBSTR to a value less than 1.0, your
      value will be used for buckling of stringer parts, but 1.0 will
      be used for buckling of ring parts.
  
      If you want postbuckling capability, but you do not want local
      buckling of the stringer parts to occur at less than a certain
      fraction of the applied load, then set FSBSTR equal to that
      fraction of the load. For  example, suppose the load set
      Nx, Ny, Nxy corresponds to an ultimate load that is 1.5 times
      the design load. You may not want local buckling to occur below
      a limit load that is 1.25 times the design load. To enforce this
      constraint, set FSBSTR = 1.25/1.50 = 0.8333. If you are not
      bothered by local buckling of the stringer parts at all, set
      FSBSTR equal to zero.

      IF YOU PLAN TO USE A VALUE OF FSBSTR THAT IS LESS THAN UNITY,
      MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ CAREFULLY ITEMS 37, 60(c), AND 67 IN
      PANDA2.NEWS.

750.1 Factor of safety for stress, FSSTR
750.2 
      This factor should account for the fact that the theory used
      to calculate stress, expecially if local buckling of the skin
      occurs well below the design load, is approximate.  The failure
      criterion is also approximate. Use

                    1.0  <   FSSTR    <  1.5

751.0 
      You will next be asked if the material in the STAGS model
      can go plastic. For comparison with PANDA2 you will usually
      answer N (no). However, occasionally you may want to answer
      Y (yes). If you answer Y you will be asked to provide a
      stress-strain curve for the material and the number of
      integration points thru the wall thickness.

      NOTE: Answer Y only if the panel and stiffeners are all
            made of only one isotropic material. This "plasticity"
            option does not work for panels made of more than one
            material. The "plasticity" option WILL work provided
            that all the materials specified in BEGIN (*.BEG file)
            have the same isotropic properties.

      ANOTHER NOTE: The FIRST stress-strain coordinates you
                    provide MUST agree with the elastic modulus
                    you provided in BEGIN, that is, 
                    (first stress value)/(first strain value) = E

752.1 Is there plasticity in this STAGS model?
752.2 
      Usually you will answer N (no). You can answer Y (yes) if
      the panel is fabricated from a single isotropic material.
      Sometimes in BEGIN (*.BEG file) you may specify more than
      one material but all materials have the same isotropic
      properties. Then you can answer Y also.

753.1 Strain coordinate of stress-strain curve, STRAIN
753.2 
      Your first strain-stress coordinate MUST be consistent
      with the isotropic elastic modulus you provided in
      BEGIN (*.BEG file), that is:
      (first stress point)/(first strain point) = E.

754.1 Stress coordinate of stress-strain curve, STRESS
754.2
      Your first stress-strain coordinate MUST be consistent
      with the isotropic elastic modulus you provided in
      BEGIN (*.BEG file), that is:
      (first stress point)/(first strain point) = E.

755.1 Are there any more stress-strain coordinates?
755.2 
      You may provide a maximum of 10 points

756.1 Number of integration points over thickness, NLIP
756.2 
      Must be an odd integer, 5 or 7 or 9 .
      Suggested value: 5

      NOTE: All walls (shell skin, stiffener parts) use the
            same value of NLIP, the one you provide here.

757.1 Is there pressure that varies over the panel surface?
757.2 
      Y or N . If Y, then PANDA2 assumes that this pressure is in
      Load Set A. If you have uniform internal pressure and non-
      uniform external pressure, put the uniform internal pressure
      in Load Set B.

      If Y , then PANDA2 will next ask for information about how
      the normal pressure varies over the panel surface. NOTE: it
      is assumed by PANDA2 that the pressure over the surface of
      the panel (with smeared rings and stringers) is expressed in
      the form:
                   p(x,y) = f(x)*g(y)

      f(x) is established by values at callout points with
           linear interpolation between callout points.
      g(y) is expanded in a Fourier series.

758.1 NSTART= starting number of circ. waves (lin. stress analysis)
758.2    
      PANDA2 is valid for both positive and negative values of the
      circumferential wave number, n.  For positive n the normal
      displacement w varies around the circumference as sin(n*theta),
      whereas for negative n,  w varies as cos(n*theta).  The table
      below shows how other variables and loads vary with + or - n:

      where g(theta) is a Fourier series defined below.  In the
      figure on p. 74 the loads PT, PC, and PN are called p1, p2, p3,
      respectively.

772.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith loading callout, z
772.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

774.1 NTHETA= number of circumferential callouts for load
774.2  
      Range of NTHETA is 2 to 100, and the callout locations
      must be in the range 0.LE.THETA.LE.THETAM, in which
      THETAM has already been provided by you. (It is usually
      180.0 deg.)

775.1 NOPT  = control for how g(THETA) is to be input (1,2,or 3)
775.2  
      g(THETA) represents the circumferential variation of
      the load.
      NOPT = 1 means that g(THETA) is neither odd nor even
      about THETA = 0, and that therefore, both YPLUS(J) and
      YMINUS(J), J=1,NTHETA, are going to be read in. YPLUS and
      YMINUS are the values of g(THETA) at the circumferential
      callout points.
       
      NOPT = 2 means that g(THETA) is either odd or even about
      THETA = 0, and that therefore, only YPLUS(J),J=1,NTHETA
      need by provided.

      NOPT = 3 means that g(THETA) is to be calculated from a
      user-written subroutine, GETY, an example of which is
      listed on p. 77, bottom.

776.1 NODD  = control integer for oddness, evenness, of g(THETA)
776.2  
      NODD = 1 means g(THETA) even for -THETAM.LE.THETA.LE.+THETAM
      NODD = 2 means g(THETA) odd
      NODD = 3 means g(THETA) is general (neither even nor odd)

777.1 THETA = circumferential coordinate, in degrees, THETA
777.2  
      The first value must be 0. and the last must be THETAM.
      All values must be positive and less than or equal to 180.
      The values need not be evenly spaced in THETA.

778.1 YPLUS = value of g(THETA) at THETA
778.2  
      Note that the total load is a product f(I) or f(s) times
      g(THETA), where f has already been supplied by you. It is
      usually a good idea to normalize g(THETA) so that its
      maximum value is unity.  Then the sign and the magnitude
      of the load can be associated with the factor, f(I) or f(s).

779.1 YMINUS= value of g(-THETA) at THETA
779.2  

      See the explanation under "HELP" for YPLUS.

780.1 Do you want to print out output Fourier expansion of load?
781.0
      Next you will be asked to supply properties of the weld land:
      KLAND = number of BOSOR4-type segments in the weld land:
              If there is no extra stringer along the generator
              at the edges of the weld land, KLAND = 1
              If there is a Tee-shaped stringer, KLAND = 3
              If there is a rectangular stringer, KLAND = 2
      WLAND = width of the weld land in the circumferential direction.
      TLAND = thickness of the weld land (uniform)
      TWLAND= thickness of the web of the extra weld land stringer
      HWLAND= height of the web of the extra weld land stringer
      TFLAND= thickness of the outstanding flange of the weld land stringer
      WFLAND= width of the outstanding flange of the weld land stringer
      ECLAND= eccentricity of the weld land middle surface relative to 
              the middle surface of the rest of the cylindrical shell

782.1 Number of BOSOR4-type segments in the weld land, KLAND
782.2 
      KLAND = 1 if there are no "extra" stringers along its two
                generators (axially oriented edges)
      KLAND = 2 if there are extra edge stringers with rectangular
                cross sections
      KLAND = 3 if there are extra edge stringers with Tee-shaped
                cross sections

783.1 Width of the weld land, WLAND
783.2
      For NASA-type launch vehicles the width should be something
      like 4 inches.
      NOTE: in the BOSOR4-type model we assume no tapering of the
      weld land thickness. The weld land has uniform thickness.

784.1 Thickness of the weld land, TLAND
784.2 
      We assume the thickness is uniform. No tapering accounted for
      in the BOSOR4-type model.

785.1 Thickness of "extra" weld land edge stringer web, TWLAND
785.2 
      If KLAND > 1 there are "extra" stringers along the two
      axially oriented edges of the weld land, where the weld
      land is joined to the rest of the cylindrical shell. These
      "extra" stringers may have either rectangular (KLAND = 2)
      or Tee-shaped (KLAND = 3) cross sections.

786.1 Height of "extra" weld land stringer web, HWLAND
786.2 
      If KLAND > 1 there are "extra" stringers along the two
      axially oriented edges of the weld land, where the weld
      land is joined to the rest of the cylindrical shell. These
      "extra" stringers may have either rectangular (KLAND = 2)
      or Tee-shaped (KLAND = 3) cross sections.

787.1 Thickness of outstanding flange of weld land stringer, TFLAND
787.2
      If KLAND > 1 there are "extra" stringers along the two
      axially oriented edges of the weld land, where the weld
      land is joined to the rest of the cylindrical shell. These
      "extra" stringers may have either rectangular (KLAND = 2)
      or Tee-shaped (KLAND = 3) cross sections.

788.1 Width of outstanding flange of weld land stringer, WFLAND
788.2 
      If KLAND > 1 there are "extra" stringers along the two
      axially oriented edges of the weld land, where the weld
      land is joined to the rest of the cylindrical shell. These
      "extra" stringers may have either rectangular (KLAND = 2)
      or Tee-shaped (KLAND = 3) cross sections.

789.1 Eccentricity of the weld land outer surface, ECLAND
789.2 
      ECLAND = 0.0 means middle surface of weld land is flush with
                   the middle surface of the rest of the cylindrical
                   shell
      ECLAND = positive means middle surface of the weld land lies
               inside the middle surface of the rest of the shell.
      ECLAND = negative means middle surface of the weld lane lies
               outside the middle surface of the rest of the shell.

      Units of ECLAND should be length (such as inches, for example).

790.1 Do you want to prevent secondary buckling (mode jumping)?
790.2 
      "Secondary Buckling" means mode jumping, or post-post-local buckling.
      Mode jumping is initiated by local bifurcation buckling in a panel
      skin which has already been loaded well beyond initial local buckling.
      Mode jumping might cause material failure, especially for composite
      walls that delaminate relatively easily.

      Example of secondary buckling: Suppose you have an axially stiffened
      panel under pure axial compression.  For axial loads well above that
      corresponding to local buckling of the panel skin between stringers
      the internal axial resultant Nx in the skin becomes concentrated near
      the stringers. The question is, under the redistributed Nx does local
      bifurcation buckling occur for a load factor less than unity? If so,
      then mode jumping is possible. 
      
      NOTE: Your panel may become a lot heavier if you elect to prevent
            mode jumping. It may be a good idea to obtain optimum designs
            both with Y and N answers to this question. See the papers,
            AIAA-97-1141: "Optimization of stiffened panels in which
            mode jumping is accounted for" (1997 SDM Meeting), and
            AIAA-98-1990: "Optimization of panels with riveted z-shpaed
            stiffeners via PANDA2 (1998 SDM Meeting) for some guidance.

792.1 Do you want to use the "alternative" buckling solution?
792.2 
      The "alternative" buckling solution is more accurate but uses
      much more computer time than the "regular" solution. The "regular"
      solution is the PANDA-type closed form solution obtained from the
      assumed displacement field given by Eqs. (50) in the paper,
      "Theoretical basis...", Computers and Structures, Vol. 27,
      pp 541-563, 1987, leading to Eq. (57) on p. 553 of that paper. The
      "alternative" solution is obtained via double-trig series
      expansions for buckling modal displacement components,  u, v, w.
      It is described in detail in ITEM 438 of ...panda2/doc/panda2.news.

      SUGGESTION: Start optimization by answering "N". Then finalize
      with use of the answer "Y".

793.1 Factor of safety for "alternative" model of general buckling
793.2 
      SUGGESTION: Use the same factor of safety that you use for
      inter-ring buckling in the PANDA-type model, that is, FSPAN.

      The critical buckling mode for general buckling with use of
      the "alternative" (double-trigonometric series expansion)
      buckling model is often a relatively short-wavelength mode
      such as that displayed in Fig. 20 on p. 1607 of the paper,
      "Optimization of perfect and imperfect ring and stringer
      stiffened cylindrical shells wih PANDA2 and evaluation of
      the optimum designs with STAGS", AIAA Paper 2002-1408,
      AIAA 43rd SDM Meeting, Denver, Colorado, 2002. The short-
      wavelength critical buckling mode may resemble inter-ring
      buckling. Even if it does not, the "alternative" general
      buckling model is based on a sub-domain or "patch" of the
      complete shell with simple support boundary conditions
      along its four edges. Therefore, the buckling modal components
      with the longest wavelengths have half-wavelengths of maximum
      length equal to the length and width of the "patch".

      If there are no stiffeners, then you should probably use
      the same factor of safety as is used for the PANDA-type
      model of general buckling.
      
795.0

      Next you will be asked for the number of design iterations.
      This is the number of iterations corresponding to a single
      execution of PANDAOPT, not the total number of iterations
      to be processed for your entire case. It is almost always
      best to use a small number like 5 iterations. The best
      optimization strategy is explained in connection with Fig. 83
      on p. 582 of the long 1987 PANDA2 paper, "PANDA2 - Program
      for minimum weight design of stiffened, composite, locally
      buckled panels. Computers & Structures, Vol. 25, No. 4,
      pp. 469 - 605, 1987. You should get an optimum design by
      several executions of PANDAOPT with 5 iterations in each
      execution. Better yet, use SUPEROPT. With many executions of
      PANDAOPT and few design iterations with each execution you
      obtain the most efficient convergence to an optimum design.
      When you execute SUPEROPT you get more "starting" designs
      per SUPEROPT run when you use a small number like 5 for the
      number of iterations, therefore a more complete exploration of
      design space in the search for the best "global" optimum design.
      The developer of PANDA2 almost always uses 5 iterations.

800.1 How many design iterations permitted in this run (5 to 25)?
800.2 
      Choose a number between 5 and 25, usually 5 to 8.
      If the design margins seem to jump around quite a
      bit, or if the weight cycles from iteration set to
      iteration set, use a high number of iterations (20 or 25).

801.1 MAXMAR. Plot only those margins less than MAXMAR (Type H)
801.2  
      Choose a number between  1  and  10.  1 to 5 is best.
      Every time you give the command PANDAOPT the results from
      the design iterations associated with the resulting batch
      run are stored in a binary file called NAME.PL1, in which
      NAME is your chosen name for the case. These results are
      re-organized in a processor called STORE and added to
      similarly re-organized results from previous PANDAOPT
      runs for the same case.  If MAXMAR is too large, you may
      be swamped with data (for example, hundreds of stress
      margins generated for multilayered composite panels)
      that you don't really need to see.  Try MAXMAR = 1 to 5.
      The bigger the case (more variables, more load sets, more
      iterations) the smaller MAXMAR should be. Note that MAXMAR
      must be greater than or equal to 1. 

802.1 Do you want to reset total iterations to zero (Type H)?
802.2 
      PANDA2 accumulates results from all iterations from the
      start of the case. These results can be plotted via the
      processors CHOOSEPLOT and DIPLOT.  It is possible that
      you may no longer want to plot results from previous runs;
      you may want to make a "fresh" start, but with use of the
      current design state rather than the original design
      state from the NAME.BEG file.  You can do this by answering
      Y to this question.  Then ITRTOT will be set to zero.
      Likely occasions to reset ITRTOT to zero are:
      1. If you started from a very bad design state;
      2. If you are changing IQUICK, the integer that points to
         the type of analysis that you are doing;
      3. If you are changing one or more load sets or edge
         conditions.
      4. If you already have lots of iterations and plotting is
         too time consuming.

803.1 Index for objective (1=min. weight, 2=min. distortion)
803.2 
      1 means that PANDA2 will find the minimum weight of the panel.
        You must have previously assigned non-zero density to at
        least one part of the panel.

      2 means that PANDA2 will find the minimum distortion of the
        panel due to uniform temperature changes.  To use this option,
        you must have previously assigned non-zero coefficient of thermal
        expansion to at least one part of the panel, and you must have
        assigned nonzero curing temperature to all parts of the panel
        that have nonzero coefficients of thermal expansion. This curing
        temperature should be the same in all these parts. PANDA2
        minimizes the quantity 

             DISTORTION=SQRT{ ET1**2 +ET2**2 
                            +[TEFF(1)*ET4]**2 +[TEFF(2)*ET5]**2 }

        in which ET1, ET2, ET4, ET5 are the thermal strains and
        changes in curvature due to curing for the panel with smeared 
        stiffeners and TEFF(1) and TEFF(2) are the effective thicknesses
        of the panel with smeared stiffeners in the axial and circ.
        coordinate directions, respectively.

804.1 FMARG (Skip load case with min. margin greater than FMARG)
804.2 
      Generally use FMARG > 0.5. FMARG must be greater than 0.1.
      If you have an optimization problem with many load sets, and
      a lot of computer time is required for design iterations,
      you might want to set FMARG to a number as low as 0.2 or even,
      in extremely long-running cases, to a number as small as 0.11.

      You should have as the first load case that which is most
      likely to generate the most critical design margins.

      In the first design iteration of each PANDAOPT, PANDA2 will
      explore all of the load cases and subcases. The test for possible
      elimination of a load subcase is applied only after completion
      of all calculations for the first design iteration. If the
      test on minimum margin for a load subcase indicates that that
      subcase should be skipped, it will be skipped for all remaining
      design iterations in the current PANDAOPT except the last,
      during which calculations for that load subcase are reintroduced.
      If that last iteration shows any negative margins, you must
      raise the value of FMARG before executing PANDAOPT again.
      Otherwise, the design that evolves will have negative margins.

805.1 Do you want to allow local buckling of the skin?
805.2  
      A panel can be designed so that the skin between stiffeners
      buckles locally at loads well below the design allowable. If
      you wish to permit local buckling in the design, answer Y.
      The analysis will then account for the effect of local
      skin buckling on the overall stiffness of the panel and will
      calculate stresses in the locally postbuckled skin. The
      buckling load factor corresponding to local buckling will NOT
      constrain the design.

      If you answer N, local skin deformations and stresses, as well
      as effective stiffnesses of locally deformed skin, will still
      be calculated, but the buckling load factor corresponding to
      local buckling between stringers WILL constrain the design.

806.1 Do rings retard growth of postbuckling deflection (type H(elp))?
806.2 
      "Rings" are transverse stiffeners. It is conservative to answer N
      because rings actually tend to retard the growth of local post-
      buckling deflection of the skin by retarding transverse shrinkage
      of this skin.  The presence of the rings hence retards the develop-
      ment of local stress concentrations that may cause failure in the
      postbuckling regime. If you answer N, this helpful retardation
      effect will be neglected.

      You should probably do the analysis both ways, first by answering
      N and second by answering Y. This is especially true if your design
      is in the far postbuckling regime and if there exists significant
      in-plane shear loading (Nxy) and/or hoop loading, (Ny, Ny0, p).

      If you answer Y, the prediction may tend to be somewhat UNconserva-
      tive regarding maximum stress in the skin because the retardation
      effect is assumed to be uniform in the  axial direction, whereas
      in fact the rings are not as effective in retarding the growth of
      postbuckling skin deflections midway between rings as they are in
      doing so in the neighborhoods of each ring. Note, however, that
      compressive loads in the ring segments will be greater if you
      answer Y, so that crippling predictions for the ring segments
      will be UNconservative if you answer N. Do the analysis both
      ways, especially for your final design!

807.1 Do you want "flat skin" discretized module for local buckling?
807.2
      This question refers to the discretized skin-stringer single
      module model (see for example, Fig. 20(b), p. 524 of the original
      long PANDA2 paper, PANDA2 - program for minimum weight design...
      Computers and Structures, vol 25, 469-605, 1987) for local
      buckling of the panel skin between rings. This discretized
      module model is used for local buckling if the user-selected
      analysis control integer, IQUICK = 0  .

      Generally, you should answer 'Y', as this will lead to
      conservative designs. However, there may be times when neglecting
      the curvature of an axially stiffened cylindrical panel during
      computations of local buckling of the skin-stringer module leads
      to results that are too conservative. This would happen, for
      example, if the stringers were spaced at intervals that are not
      very small compared to the shell radius.

      The default answer is "Y". A "Y" answer generates IICURV = 0 and
      a "N" answer generates IICURV = 1, in which IICURV is the control
      index used in PANDA2. (IICURV=0 means "no curvature", 1 means
      "yes curvature".)

      It would be a good idea to optimize panels with this choice
      taken first one way then the other way.

      Please see panda2/news Item No. 530 for more information.
     
808.1 Do you want wide-column buckling to constrain the design?
808.2 
      The wide-column model refers to the portion of the panel
      between adjacent rings. If there are no rings the wide-column
      model refers to the entire panel.
      
      If the portion of the panel between rings is unstiffened or 
      truss-core sandwich, or isogrid you should always answer N. 
      For these configurations the wide column model is too conservative.
      
      Otherwise:
      If the inter-ring portion is flat you should probably answer Y.
      If the panel is cylindrical (curvature in the plane of the
      screen) the wide-column buckling load may be too conservative,
      leading to unnecessarily heavy designs. If, for a curved panel,
      you answer Y, then you will not have to worry as much
      about the effect of initial imperfections as you would if you
      answer N, because the wide-column buckling load is not
      sensitive to initial geomtrical imperfections if there is
      little or no interaction between local and general buckling.
      This is a difficult and not very well understood area in the
      field of shell buckling. Actually, I recommend that you design
      a panel first with use of the wide-column model of general
      instability and then without this model.  In any case, check
      your general instability load when you finish optimizing by
      running PANEL, which sets up a discretized model of the entire
      panel width with stringers treated as shell branches. If this
      PANEL model has a load factor corresponding to general instability
      less than unity, you need either to include the wide-column
      model as a constraint or increase the factor of safety.

809.1 Do you want to skip the KOITER local postbuckling analysis?
809.2
      You answered the previous question "N". Therefore, the index
      IICURV = 1 and your PANDA2 discretized single skin-stringer
      module model retains the curvature of the cylindrical panel
      skin. However, the local postbuckling KOITER theory used in
      PANDA2 is still based on the assumption that the skin is flat,
      that is, the stringers are close enough together so that it may
      not be too conservative to ignore the curvature of the
      cylindrical panel. The local postbuckling state is entered
      sooner for a skin-stringer panel module with a flat skin than
      for one with a curved skin. Therefore, the stresses computed
      from the approximate post-local buckling analysis in PANDA2 will
      be higher than those of the actual curved panel, provided that
      the local buckling load factor for the curved panel is greater
      than unity at the design load (no postbuckling occurs for the
      curved panel).
      
      If you think that the "flat skin" postbuckling model is too
      conservative, then answer "Y" to the current prompt. Then
      PANDA2 will skip the KOITER local postbuckling analysis and
      compute the stresses as if the amplitude of the local post
      buckling deformation is zero.

      The default answer is "N". A "N" answer generates IIKOIT = 1 and
      a "Y" answer generates IIKOIT = 0, in which IIKOIT is the control
      index used in PANDA2. (IIKOIT=0 means "don't perform postbuckling
      computations", 1 means "yes, perform postbuckling computations".)

      It would be a good idea to optimize panels with this choice
      taken first one way then the other way.

      ******* NOTE ********
      If you are planning to do a ITYPE=3 analysis, you MUST
      choose a "N" answer here. [ITYPE=3 = fixed design under
      increasing load (test simulation)].
      ***** END NOTE ******

810.1 Enter control ILAND for weldland (0=none or 1=weldland)
810.2  
      ILAND = 0 means this BOSOR4 model has no weldland segment.
      ILAND = 1 means this BOSOR4 model has one or more weldland
                segments.

811.1 Is the nodal point spacing uniform along the stringer axis?
811.2 
      Generally answer Y. If you have a panel in which bending
      is significant, and if PANDA2 predicts many axial halfwaves
      in the local buckling pattern, (more than 10, for example),
      then you might answer N. You will then be asked further
      questions about the distribution of nodal points in the axial
      direction, x.

      If local buckling occurs only near the midlength of the
      panel (because of bending under pressure, for example)
      then you might want to concentrate nodal points in that region.
      If local buckling might occur both near the midlength of the
      panel and near the ends (bending of a clamped panel under
      pressure, for example) then you might want to concentrate
      nodal points near the midlength and near one or both ends
      of the panel.

812.1 Number of nodes in the X-direction: NODEX
812.2 
      NODEX must be an odd integer. It may be changed later.
      The X-direction is the direction along the stringer axis.
      You should have at least three nodes per axial halfwave of
      the local buckling pattern.

      This input datum is not used if there are rings.

813.0 
      NOMENCLATURE:
           x = axial coordinate:  range of x: 0 .LE. x .LE. XSTAGS
               where XSTAGS is the axial length of panel in the
               model to be analyzed by the STAGS computer program.
          dx = nodal point spacing
        X(i) = ith value of x at which nodal point spacing dx changes.
        n(i) = number of nodes from x = X(i-1) to X(i), including the
               nodes at x=X(i-1) and at x = X(i).  NOTE: n(i) must be odd!
      DISCUSSION:
      Next, you will be asked to provide an axial callout X(i) and
      the number of axial nodes n(i) between the previous callout
      X(i-1) where the nodal point spacing changed and the present
      callout X(i), including the nodal points at X(i-1) and X(i).
      For the first callout, x=X(1), do NOT enter 0, but enter the
      first value of x for which the nodal point spacing changes. Then
      enter the number of nodes n(1) from the panel end at x=0 to
      x=X(1), including the nodes at x=0 and at x=X(1). Continue with
      the input as shown in the example below. The final axial callout
      must NOT correspond to the end x=XSTAGS, but must be the last
      interior value of x for which the nodal point spacing varies.
      EXAMPLE:
      N  $ Is the nodal point spacing uniform along the stringer axis?
       4.$ Axial callout X(i) where the nodal point spacing changes,X(1)
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from X(i-1) to X(i) (n=odd!), n(1)
      Y  $ Are there any more interior axial stations x where dx changes?
      16.$ Axial callout X(i) where the nodal point spacing changes,X(2)
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from X(i-1) to X(i) (n=odd!), n(2)
      Y  $ Are there any more interior axial stations x where dx changes?
      20.$ Axial callout X(i) where the nodal point spacing changes,X(3)
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from X(i-1) to X(i) (n=odd!), n(3)
      Y  $ Are there any more interior axial stations x where dx changes?
      32.$ Axial callout X(i) where the nodal point spacing changes,X(4)
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from X(i-1) to X(i) (n=odd!), n(4)
      N  $ Are there any more interior axial stations x where dx changes?
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from last X to x = XSTAGS,    n(5)

814.1 Axial callout X(i) where the nodal point spacing changes, X
814.2 
      Do not include the axial coordinates at the ends of the panel.

815.1 Number of nodes n(i) from X(i-1) to X(i) (n=odd!), n
815.2 
      NOTE:  n(i) must be an odd number. Include the nodes at
             the beginning X(i-1) and at the end X(i) of the x-range.

816.1 Are there any more interior axial stations x where dx changes?
816.2 
      dx = nodal point spacing in the axial (x) direction.
      NOTE: Do not include the axial stations corresponding to the
            ends of the panel at x = 0 and x = XSTAGS.
      
817.1 Number of nodes n(i) from last X to x = XSTAGS, n
817.2 
      NOTE:  n(i) must be an odd number. Include the nodes at
             the beginning X(i-1) and at the end XSTAGS of the x-range.

818.1 Have you obtained buckling modes from STAGS for this case?
818.2 

      In order to include the effect of initial imperfections
      in the STAGS model, you must have previously generated buckling
      modes from either an INDIC = 1 (linear bifurcation) analysis or
      an INDIC = 4 (bifurcation from nonlinear prebuckled state)
      analysis.

      If your answer is N the amplitude of the imperfection
      WIMPL that you provided above will be set to zero, and your
      STAGS run will therefore NOT include the effect of initial
      imperfections.  If you want to include the effect of initial
      imperfections, run STAGS with either the INDIC = 1 or
      INDIC = 4 options first.

819.1 Number of nodes in the Y-direction: NODEY
819.2
      NODEY must be an odd integer. It may be changed later.
      The Y-direction is the direction around the circumference.
      You should have at least three nodes per circumferential
      halfwave of the general or inter-ring buckling pattern.

      This input datum is not used if there are stringers that
      are not to be smeared out.

820.1 Enter control (0 or 1) for stringers at panel edges
820.2  
      0 means edge is half a stringer spacing away from nearest
        stringer;

      1 means there is a stringer at each of the edges
        of the panel normal to the plane of the screen.

821.1 Enter control (0 or 1) for rings at the cylinder ends
821.2  
      0 means each end is half a ring spacing away from the nearest
        ring;

      1 means there is a ring at each of the ends of
        the cylindrical shell.

822.1 Enter control (1=sym; 2=s.s.) for boundary condition
822.2 
      1 means symmetry conditions applied at the edges of the
        panel normal to the plane of the screen;

      2 means simple support conditions applied at the edges of the
        panel normal to the plane of the screen.

823.1 Enter control (1=sym; 2=s.s.) for boundary condition
823.2 
      1 means symmetry conditions are applied at the ends of the
        cylindrical shell.

      2 means simple support conditions are applied at the ends of the
        cylindrical shell.

824.1 Enter control (1=sym; 2=s.s.; 3=clamp) for buckling b.c.
824.2 
      1 means symmetry conditions are applied at the ends of the
        cylindrical shell.

      2 means simple support conditions are applied at the ends of
        the cylindrical shell (bifurcation buckling phase only).
        The prebuckling condition is "moving" clamped.

      3 means clamped conditions are applied at the ends of the
        cylindrical shell (both prebuckling and bifurcation phases).

825.1 Enter ILOCAL=0 or 1 or -1 or -2 (Type (H)elp), ILOCAL
825.2 
      ILOCAL=0  (panel buckling) means that tangent stiffnesses will
      be used for the wall stiffnesses.  The Nx, Ny, Nxy distributions
      over the panel module cross section are those calculated in the
      Koiter branch of PANDA2, that is, Nx, Ny, Nxy are for the locally
      postbuckled panel. You will generally select NWAVE=1 axial
      halfwaves when you are asked to supply a value for NWAVE. The
      axial length of the shell is the length between adjacent rings.

      ILOCAL = 1 (local buckling) means that original stiffnesses will
      be used for the wall stiffnesses of the various segments in the
      panel module. The Nx, Ny, Nxy distributions over the panel module
      cross section are those calculated from SUBROUTINE FORCEX, that
      is, Nx, Ny, Nxy are for the panel with no local buckling. You
      will generally select NWAVE = number of axial halfwaves that
      corresponds to the minimum local buckling load factor, EIGOLD,
      computed by PANDA2. (See the *.OPM file). The axial length of the
      shell is the length between adjacent rings.

      ILOCAL = -1 (general buckling) The original stiffnesses are used
      for the shell skin with smeared rings [CY(i,j,5)]. The tangent
      stiffnesses are used for the stringer segments. The axial length
      of the shell model is the total length of the shell multiplied by
      the axial length modifier, LENMOD. Rings are smeared in this model.

      ILOCAL = -2 (general buckling) The original stiffnesses are used
      for the shell skin with all stiffeners smeared [CS(i,j)]. The
      axial length of the shell model is the total length of the shell
      multiplied by the axial length modifier, LENMOD.

826.1 Enter control (2=s.s.; 3=clamp; H(elp)) for buckling b.c.
826.2 
      You are running "PANEL2" with the INDIC=4 option (prebuckled
      state of the panel derived by PANDA2, not by BOSOR4). There are
      no rings. In order to be able to use the prebuckling stress
      resultant distribution from PANDA2 for this special case, the
      BOSOR4 model is different from that generated with INDIC = 1
      and no rings. With INDIC = 1 and no rings the boundary conditions
      are applied at the bottom and top of the BOSOR4 model. With INDIC
      = 4 and no rings the boundary condition is applied at the
      midlength of the cylindrical shell, and symmetry conditions are
      applied at the bottom and top of the BOSOR4 model.

      Permitted values of control integer for b.c. at the midlength
      of the cylindrical shell in this case:

        2 means simple support conditions are applied at the midlength
          of the cylindrical shell (bifurcation buckling phase only).
          The prebuckling condition there is "moving" clamped.

        3 means clamped conditions are applied at the midlength of the
          cylindrical shell (both prebuckling and bifurcation phases).

827.1 Number of halfwaves in the axial direction [see H(elp)],NWAVE
827.2
      For general instability, NWAVE is usually equal to 1.

      For a value you might use, inspect the NAME.OPM file. In the
      list of buckling margins you will find the number of axial
      halfwaves predicted via PANDA2 for various kinds of buckling.

      You can use PANEL/BOSORALL to check the PANDA2 results via
      BOSOR4 for general and/or local buckling, and for buckling
      of the stiffener parts, and for stiffener rolling. Please note
      that:
       1. BOSOR4 does not account for shear loading in its predictions
          of buckling, so that PANDA2 and BOSOR4 results will agree
          only if there is no applied in-plane shear loading.
       2. BOSOR4 does not account for the transverse shear deformation
          effect.

830.1 How many eigenvalues (get at least 3) do you want?
830.2  
      For panels with lots of stiffeners it is a good idea to
      calculate about 10 eigenvalues. You must get enough to
      capture at least one of what might be called a general
      instability mode.

832.1 Starting number of circumferential waves [see H(elp)],N0B
832.2
      For a value you might use, inspect the NAME.OPM file. In the
      list of buckling margins you will find the number of circumf.
      halfwaves predicted via PANDA2 for various kinds of buckling.

      You can use PANEL/BOSORALL to check the PANDA2 results via
      BOSOR4 for general and/or local buckling, and for buckling
      of the stiffener parts, and for stiffener rolling. Please note
      that:
       1. BOSOR4 does not account for shear loading in its predictions
          of buckling, so that PANDA2 and BOSOR4 results will agree
          only if there is no applied in-plane shear loading.
       2. BOSOR4 does not account for the transverse shear deformation
          effect.

833.1 Ending number of circumferential waves [see H(elp)],NMAXB
833.2
      You can make NMAXB = N0B if you want, then explore a wide
      range of circ. waves with use of the BOSOR4 processors
      RESETUP/RESTART.  Or you can explore a range here. If you
      want very compact output, use RESETUP/RESTART for the wide
      range of circ. wavenumbers n.

834.1 Increment in number of circumferential waves, INCRB
834.2 
      It's a good idea to make the increment of circ. wavenumber n
      equal to a certain percentage of n, say 10 per cent. Then
      you won't get results for lots of n when n corresponding
      to the critical (lowest) buckling load factor is very high.

835.1 Number of eigenvalues for each circ. wavenumber, NVEC
835.2 
      Usually you want only the lowest eigenvalue for each circ.
      wavenumber n. However, sometimes you may want more than one
      eigenvalue for each n. Use NVEC = 1 if you are exploring
      a wide range of circ. wavenumber n.

836.0 
      This program permits you to change certain quantities without
      starting over from the beginning (without having to use BEGIN).
  
      Parameters that you can change are segregated into three sets:
  
         1. parameters that are "elegible" to be decision variables;
         2. parameters that are always considered to be fixed
            during design iterations: they are not elegible
            to be decision variables;
         3. parameters that are allowables, such as max. stress.

      You will next be asked if you want to change any parameters in
      set no. 1, and if so, which; then you will be asked the same
      questions relative to set no. 2; and finally the same questions
      relative to set no. 3.

838.1 Do you want to change any values in Parameter Set No. 1?
838.2  
      Parameter Set No. 1 contains all parameters that are elegible
      to be decision variables. (Note that they may not actually be
      decision variables; they are merely elegible to be so.)
  
840.1 Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
840.2 
      Choose an index from the left-most column in the above table.

850.1 New value of the parameter
850.2 
      Remember to change lower and upper bounds via DECIDE if such
      a change is required to be consistent with the new value of
      the parameter.

860.1 Want to change any other parameters in this set?
870.1 Do you want to change values of "fixed" parameters?
870.2 
      This means changing values of parameters that can never be
      decision variables, such as a modulus or the overall dimensions
      of the panel.  Please do not change the types of stiffeners. 
      If you want different types of stiffeners, use BEGIN .
  
880.1 Do you want to change values of allowables?
880.2 
      Allowables include maximum stress. We do not refer
      here to upper or lower bounds of decision variables or to
      behavioral variables, such as buckling loads or natural
      frequencies.  

885.0 
      Next you will be asked to provide tables of core crush strength,
      core transverse shear strengths, and facesheet pull-off modifier
      vs core weight density for the current sandwich core material.
      You will be asked to provide the following input data:
       0. Do you want to skip this input because the current sandwich
          core material uses the same tables as a previous core material?
       1. Do you want to use lb/ft**3 (PCF) units for input of the weight
          density coordinate of the tables? (PCF is popular, and PANDA2
          will automatically convert to the units you are using for the
          rest of this case. (You must provide the conversion factor).
       2. Conversion factor from PCF to your units for weight density:
          (weight density in YOUR units) = (conversion factor)*(PCF)
       3. Core weight density (in YOUR units if 1. was "NO"; else in PCF)
       4. Crushing strength (in YOUR units of stress, please)
       5. "L"-direction shear strength (in YOUR units of stress)
       6. "W"-direction shear strength (in YOUR units of stress)
       7. facesheet pull-off modifier (dimensionless: near unity)
       8. Core thickness (in YOUR units)
       9. Thickness knockdown factor for both "L"- and "W"-direction
          shear strengths (dimensionless)
      Items 3 - 9 keep repeating (up to a maximum of 10 times) until you
      want to quit. During computations PANDA2 will compute crushing
      pressure and the maximum transverse shear stresses, Qx/t and Qy/t
      (See ITEM 294), then interpolate the tabular allowables and
      construct constraint conditions for failure of the sandwich core
      and pull-off of the sandwich facesheets.

886.1 Do you want to use previous tables for this material?
886.2 
      Providing the following input data can take some time, so that
      if the same tabular data for a previous core material will
      suffice for the present material, you should answer Y .  Then
      PANDA2 will ask you which previous material can the present
      material share the same tables with.

887.1 Identify material number of previous sandwich core material
887.2 
      That is, the previous material number that will use the same
      data tables for crushing and core shear failure allowables.
      NOTE: the previous material has to point to a sandwich core!
      ANOTHER NOTE: If you don't want to bother with core crushing
                    or allowable transverse shear core stresses,
                    then supply zero for the material number. Then
                    PANDA2 sets these quantities to 10.E+16.

891.1 Do you want to provide tabular weight density in PCF?
891.2 
      "PCF" = "lb/ft**3". Many commercial manuals, such as Hexcel
      Corporation's "TSB-120 Mechanical properties of honeycomb", contain
      graphs of core crushing strength and "L-" and "W"-direction
      core transverse shear strengths as functions of core weight
      density in "PCF". If you answer "y", PANDA2 will ask you for a
      conversion factor to convert PCF to the units of this case:

              (units of this case) = (Conversion factor)*PCF

      Example:

                        (lb/in**3) = (1./1728)*PCF

      In this particular example, user must supply (1./1728) = 0.0005787

892.1 Please provide conversion factor for PCF to YOUR units.
892.2 
      "PCF" means lb/ft**3 .
      Conversion factor to convert PCF to YOUR units for this case:

          (YOUR units of this case) = (Conversion factor)*PCF

      Example:

              (YOUR units) = (lb/in**3) = (1./1728)*PCF

      In this particular example, user must supply (1./1728) = 0.0005787

893.1 Weight density of sandwich core in lb/ft**3 (PCF)
893.2 
      Must be positive. Make sure the values you provide in this
      table span the design space that PANDA2 will explore.

894.1 Weight density of sandwich core in YOUR units
894.2 
      Must be positive. Make sure the values you provide in this
      table span the design space that PANDA2 will explore.

895.1 Sandwich core crushing strength (e.g. psi, Mpa)       
895.2 
      Must be positive. Make sure the values you provide in this
      table span the design space that PANDA2 will explore.

896.1 "L"-direction transverse shear strength of core (e.g. psi)
896.2 
      Must be positive. Make sure the values you provide in this
      table span the design space that PANDA2 will explore.
      NOTE: With honeycomb core the "L" direction is always assumed
      by PANDA2 to coincide with the axial direction. The "L"-direction
      is the "strong" direction of the honeycomb core. If the core is
      not honeycomb, then use whatever positive values you want.

897.1 "W"-direction transverse shear strength of core (e.g. psi)
897.2 
      Must be positive. Make sure the values you provide in this
      table span the design space that PANDA2 will explore.
      NOTE: With honeycomb core the "W" direction is always assumed
      by PANDA2 to coincide with the coordinate in the plane of the
      module segment and normal to the axial direction. The "W"-direction
      is the "weak" direction of the honeycomb core. If the core is
      not honeycomb, then use whatever positive values you want.

898.1 Modifying factor for honeycomb cell wall pullout, MODIFY
898.2 
      Honeycomb cell wall pullout force can be obtained from a test
      such as shown below:
     
          ____facesheet
         /
        /
       /
      ||// <---adhesive
      ||//
      ||//
      ||///
      ||////
      ||///////
      ||/////////////////////////////// <--adhesive
      ||------------------------------------ honeycomb cell wall-->FPULL
      ||/////////////////////////////// <--adhesive
      ||///////
      ||////
      ||///
      ||//
      ||//
      ||// <---adhesive

      From the quantity FPULL, PANDA2 computes an allowable normal
      tensile stress for the adhesive from the formula:

       sigma(adhesive normal allowable) = 2*FPULL*MODIFY/(1.732*s)

      in which s is the length of one of the facets of the regular
      honeycomb core cell and MODIFY is a modifying factor that you
      now provide in order to generate a table of (MODIFY) vs
      (sandwich core density).
  
899.1 Do you want to provide more entries in the input data table?
899.2 
      You can provide up to 10 sets of (core weight density, core
      crushing strength, core "L"-direction transverse shear strength,
      and core "W"-direction transverse shear strength)

900.0 
      Next you will be asked to provide a table of "knockdown" values
      for sandwich core transverse shear strength. These values are
      a function of the sandwich core thickness. It is assumed here
      that the same knockdown applies to both the "L"-direction
      core transverse shear strength and the "W"-direction core
      transverse shear strength. Make sure that you provide a table
      of core thickness vs knockdown factor that spans the design
      space that PANDA2 will cover.

901.1 sandwich core thickness
901.2 
      Must be positive. Make sure the values you provide in this
      table span the design space that PANDA2 will explore.

902.1 Knockdown factor for core transverse shear strengths
902.2 
      PANDA2 assumes that the same knockdown factor applies to both
      the "L"-direction and the "W"-direction core transverse shear
      strength components.

903.1 Do you want to provide more entries in the input data table?
903.2 
      You can provide up to 10 sets of (core thickness, knockdown
      factor for core transverse shear strengths)

904.1 Factor of safety for sandwich core transverse shear strength
904.2 
      Use a number greater than or equal to 1.0.
      The same factor of safety is used for both "L" and "W" direction
      shear strengths. It might be beneficial to do several
      optimizations with use of various factors of safety from, say,
      1.0 to 2.0.

911.1 Is the nodal point spacing uniform around the circumference?
911.2 
      Generally answer Y. If you have a panel in which bending
      is significant, and if PANDA2 predicts many circ. halfwaves
      in the local buckling pattern, (more than 10, for example),
      then you might answer N. You will then be asked further
      questions about the distribution of nodal points in the
      circumferential direction, y.

      If local buckling occurs only near an inward or outward
      lobe of a general buckling modal imperfection (because of 
      bending of an imperfect shell under pressure, for example)
      then you might want to concentrate nodal points in that region.

912.1 Number of nodes in the Y-direction: NODEY
912.2 
      NODEY must be an odd integer.
      The Y-direction is the direction along the ring axis.
      You should have at least three nodes per circ. halfwave of
      the local buckling pattern.

      NOMENCLATURE:
           y = circ. coordinate:  range of y: 0 .LE. y .LE. YSTAGS
               where YSTAGS is the circ. length of panel in the
               model to be analyzed by the STAGS computer program.
               If the panel is curved (cylindrical) y is in degrees.
          dy = nodal point spacing in the y coordinate direction
        Y(i) = ith value of y at which nodal point spacing dy changes.
               If the panel is curved (cylindrical) Y is in degrees.
        n(i) = number of nodes from x = Y(i-1) to Y(i), including the
               nodes at y=Y(i-1) and at y = Y(i).  NOTE: n(i) must be odd!
      DISCUSSION:
      Next, you will be asked to provide a circ. callout Y(i) and
      the number of axial nodes n(i) between the previous callout
      Y(i-1) where the nodal point spacing changed and the present
      callout Y(i), including the nodal points at Y(i-1) and Y(i).
      For the first callout, y=Y(1), do NOT enter 0, but enter the
      first value of y for which the nodal point spacing changes. Then
      enter the number of nodes n(1) from the panel edge at y=0 to
      y=Y(1), including the nodes at y=0 and at y=Y(1). Continue with
      the input as shown in the example below. The final circ. callout
      must NOT correspond to the end y=YSTAGS, but must be the last
      interior value of y for which the nodal point spacing varies.
      If the panel is curved (cylindrical) y and Y are in degrees.
      EXAMPLE:
      N  $ Is the nodal point spacing uniform around the circumference?
       4.$ Circ. callout Y(i) where the nodal point spacing changes,Y(1)
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from Y(i-1) to Y(i) (n=odd!), n(1)
      Y  $ Are there any more interior circ. stations y where dy changes?
      16.$ Circ. callout Y(i) where the nodal point spacing changes,Y(2)
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from Y(i-1) to Y(i) (n=odd!), n(2)
      Y  $ Are there any more interior circ. stations y where dy changes?
      20.$ Circ. callout Y(i) where the nodal point spacing changes,Y(3)
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from Y(i-1) to Y(i) (n=odd!), n(3)
      Y  $ Are there any more interior circ. stations y where dy changes?
      32.$ Circ. callout Y(i) where the nodal point spacing changes,Y(4)
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from Y(i-1) to Y(i) (n=odd!), n(4)
      N  $ Are there any more interior circ. stations y where dy changes?
      13 $ Number of nodes n(i) from last Y to y = YSTAGS,    n(5)

914.1 Circ. callout Y(i) where the nodal point spacing changes, Y
914.2 
      Do not include the circ. coordinates at the edges of the panel.
      If the panel is curved (cylindrical) Y is in degrees.

915.1 Number of nodes n(i) from Y(i-1) to Y(i) (n=odd!), n
915.2 
      NOTE:  n(i) must be an odd number. Include the nodes at
             the beginning Y(i-1) and at the end Y(i) of the y-range.

916.1 Are there any more interior axial stations y where dy changes?
916.2 
      dy = nodal point spacing in the circ. (y) direction.
      NOTE: Do not include the circ. stations corresponding to the
            edges of the panel at y = 0 and y = YSTAGS.
      
917.1 Number of nodes n(i) from last Y to y = YSTAGS, n
917.2 
      NOTE:  n(i) must be an odd number. Include the nodes at
             the beginning Y(i-1) and at the end YSTAGS of the y-range.

918.1 Do you want drilling freedoms suppressed?
918.2 
      You answer this only if you have chosen the 480 finite element
      and only if the axial distribution of nodal points is nonuniform.
      If you answer "N" (no), then you MUST include the string, RK1 ,
      in the title (first line of the *.inp file).

      Most often you should answer "Y" (yes).

      ITYPE = 3 ANALYSIS BRANCH: SIMULATING A TEST OF A PANEL WITH
                                 FIXED DESIGN. ONLY A SINGLE LOAD
                                 SET AND SUBCASE ARE INVESTIGATED
                                 IN A GIVEN RUN.

      The in-plane loads and moments of load set A, and pressure (if
      pressure is part of load set A), and temperature (if temperature
      is part of load set A) are increased in increments as follows:

                 Nx    increased in increments of   DNX
                 Ny    increased in increments of   DNY
                 Nxy   increased in increments of   DNXY
                 Mx    increased in increments of   DMX
                 My    increased in increments of   DMY
                 p     increased in increments of   DP
                 Tmult increased in increments of   DTMULT

      for a beam:
       axial load    P increased in increments of   DP
       bend. moment  M increased in increments of   DM
       latrl. load   W increased in increments of   DW

      Increments are continued until NSTEPS is reached or until
      either the general instability or panel instability load is
      reached, whichever is lower. THIS IS DONE FOR ONLY ONE LOAD SET.
      IQUICK must be zero for that load set.
     
      Certain results are stored in the file NAME.PL1 for future plotting.

925.1 Choose one of the load sets:  ILOAD
925.2 
      You can find incremental behavior with increasing load
      for only one of the load sets that you have identified.
      The incremental behavior for other load sets must be
      explored in other runs.

      ******* NOTE *******
      You MUST enter the KOITER branch [IIKOIT(ILOAD)=1] for
      the load set, ILOAD, that you choose here.
      ***** END NOTE *****

927.1 Choose one of the sub cases (1  or  2):  ICASE
927.2
      ICASE = 1 means incremental behavior at the midlength of the
                       panel will be explored.

      ICASE = 2 means incremental behavior at one of the ends of
                       the panel or, if there are rings, at a ring
                       will be explored.

      NOTE:      ICASE = 2 only if the pressure is non-zero or the
                           panel is curved.

928.0 
      We are analyzing a beam.

929.1 Increment in total axial load, P: DP

932.1 Increment in axial resultant Nx:  DNX
932.2
      Suggested values:  
          If Nx is a major component of the load and is less than zero:
          use    
                 DNX = [ Nx(critical) for general instability ]/10.
          or
                 DNX = [ Nx(critical) for panel   instability ]/10.

933.1 Increment in hoop resultant Ny:  DNY
933.2
      Suggested values:  
          If Ny is a major component of the load and is less than zero:
          use    
                 DNY = [ Ny(critical) for general instability ]/10.
          or
                 DNY = [ Ny(critical) for panel   instability ]/10.

934.1 Increment in shear resultant Nxy:  DNXY
934.2
      Suggested values:  
          If Nxy is a major component of the load:
          use    
                 DNXY = [ Nxy(critical) for general instability ]/10.
          or
                 DNXY = [ Nxy(critical) for panel   instability ]/10.

935.1 Increment in axial moment resultant Mx:  DMX
935.2
      Suggested value:  
          
          use    
                 DMX = [ Nx(critical) for general instability ]/10.
          or
                 DMX = [ Nx(critical) for panel   instability ]/10.

936.1 Increment in circumferential moment resultant My:  DMY
936.2
      Suggested value:  
          
          use    
                 DMY = [ Nx(critical) for general instability ]/10.
          or
                 DMY = [ Nx(critical) for panel   instability ]/10.

937.1 Increment in pressure, p:  DP
937.2  
      Non-zero only if pressure is in load set A.

938.1 Starting multiplier for temperature distribution, TMULT
938.2 
      The actual "delta T" (temperature differences from ambient)
      are given by TMULT*TEMP(ISEG,ILOOP), in which TEMP(ISEG,ILOOP)
      are the "applied delta T" that you have just provided for the
      various panel module segments; ISEG is 1 for the panel skin,
      2 for the base under the stiffener, 3 for the stiffener web(s),
      and 4 for the outstanding flange of the stiffener; and ILOOP is
      1 for the skin-stringer module and 2 for the skin-ring module.
      TMULT is always unity for ITYPE=1 (optimization) and for ITYPE=2
      (fixed design, fixed load) analyses.

      You should decide what range of temperature you want to cover
      in this ITYPE=3 (test simulation) analysis and establish TMULT
      so that TMULT*TEMP(ISEG,ILOOP) represents a good starting
      "delta T".

939.1 Multiplier increment for temperature distribution, DTMULT
939.2 
      The actual "delta T" (temperature differences from ambient)
      are given by [TMULT+(n-1)*DTMULT]*TEMP(ISEG,ILOOP), in which
      TEMP(ISEG,ILOOP) are the "applied delta T" for the panel module
      segments that you provided above; ISEG is 1 for the panel skin,
      2 for the base under the stiffener, 3 for the stiffener web(s),
      and 4 for the outstanding flange of the stiffener; ILOOP is 1
      for the skin-stringer module and 2 for the skin-ring module;
      and n is the load step number in the test simulation (ITYPE=3)
      analysis.

      You should decide what range of temperature you want to cover
      in this ITYPE=3 (test simulation) analysis and establish TMULT,
      NSTEPS, and DTMULT so that the temperature difference from ambient,

           [TMULT+(NSTEPS-1)*DTMULT]*TEMP(ISEG,ILOOP)

      represents a good maximum "delta T". (NSTEPS is the number of
      load steps, which you will provide next.)

940.1 Maximum number of load steps, NSTEPS
940.2 
      Use a number between 5 and 20  .

941.1 Indicate which load component to use in plots (1,2,...7)
941.2 
      Which load component (Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My, p, T) do you want
      the behaviors, strains, margins to be plotted against?

         Type the        If you want the following load component
         integer:        
            1               Nx = axial load/length
            2               Ny = hoop load/length
            3               Nxy= in-plane shear load/length
            4               Mx = axial moment/length
            5               My = hoop moment/length
            6               p  = normal pressure
            7               T  = temperature multiplier

950.0 
      Since you have chosen ITYPE = 5, you want to obtain margins as
      functions of either (Nx, Ny) or (Nx, Nxy) or (Ny, Nxy). That is,
      you want interaction curves. Next, you will be asked to select
      ICURV = 1 or 2 or 3. ICURV has the following meaning:

      ICURV = 1 means find (Nx, Ny ) interaction with Nxy held constant.
      ICURV = 2 means find (Nx, Nxy) interaction with Ny  held constant.
      ICURV = 3 means find (Ny, Nxy) interaction with Nx  held constant.

      After selecting ICURV, you will establish ranges for Nx, Ny, Nxy
      and the number of steps to use to cover the ranges. Remember to
      use correct signs for Nx, Ny, Nxy. (Negative Nx,Ny for axial, hoop
      compression; Positive Nxy as shown in Fig. 11, p 493 of the long
      PANDA2 paper in Computers and Structures, 1987).

      CAUTION: TO OBTAIN INTERACTION CURVES WITH POINTS REASONABLY
               WELL DISTRIBUTED ALONG THEM, CHOOSE LOAD RANGES FOR
               [Nx, Ny], etc. THAT ARE APPROXIMATELY PROPORTIONAL
               TO [Nx(crit), Ny(crit)], etc. For example, if Nx(crit)
               is 30 times Ny(crit), for a good (Nx,Ny) interaction
               curve, you might choose Nx(beg) = -30., Ny(beg) = 0.;
               Nx(end) - 0., Ny(end) = -1. as the end points (see below).

952.1 Select interaction, ICURV = 1 or 2 or 3: ICURV
952.2 
      ICURV = 1 means find (Nx, Ny ) interaction with Nxy held constant.
      ICURV = 2 means find (Nx, Nxy) interaction with Ny  held constant.
      ICURV = 3 means find (Ny, Nxy) interaction with Nx  held constant.

      Next, you will be asked to provide the following input data:
       (1) a value for the fixed in-plane load component,
           Nxyo if ICURV = 1;   Nyo if ICURV = 2;    Nxo if ICURV = 3
           (Make sure to use the correct sign!)
       (2) starting and ending values for:
           Nx if ICURV=1 or 2; Ny if ICURV=1 or 3; Nxy if ICURV=2 or 3
       (3) number of combinations of (N1,N2) in the ranges established
           in Step (2).

      EXAMPLE OF INPUT FOR THE OPTION ICURV = 2  [(Nx,Nxy) interaction]:
       (1) Nyo = 0.
       (2) Nx(beg) = -1000.;   Nx(end) = 0.
           Nxy(beg)= 0.    ;  Nxy(end) = 500.
       (3) default number of combinations (Nx,Nxy) to be used.

953.1 Constant in-plane shear load, Nxyo
953.2
      Units are (force/length of edge) (e.g. lb/in). See Fig. 11, p493
      of the long PANDA2 paper in Computers and Structures, Vol 25, 1987
      for convention used for positive value. Use the correct sign!

954.1 Constant hoop load, Nyo
954.2
      Units are (force/length of edge) (e.g. lb/in). Positive for
      tension. Use the correct sign!

955.1 Constant axial load, Nxo
955.2
      Units are (force/length of edge) (e.g. lb/in). Positive for
      tension. Use the correct sign!

956.1 Starting value for axial load Nx, Nx(beg)
956.2 
      Behavior and margins will be calculated for axial load Nx
      varying from Nx(beg) to Nx(end) acting in combination with
      either hoop load Ny varying from Ny(beg) to Ny(end), or
      in-plane shear load Nxy varying from Nxy(beg) to Nxy(end),
      depending on the value you selected for ICURV.

957.1 Ending value for axial load Nx, Nx(end)
957.2 
      Behavior and margins will be calculated for axial load Nx
      varying from Nx(beg) to Nx(end) acting in combination with
      either hoop load Ny varying from Ny(beg) to Ny(end), or
      in-plane shear load Nxy varying from Nxy(beg) to Nxy(end),
      depending on the value you selected for ICURV.

958.1 Starting value for hoop load Ny, Ny(beg)
958.2 
      Behavior and margins will be calculated for hoop load Ny
      varying from Ny(beg) to Ny(end) acting in combination with
      either axial load Nx varying from Nx(beg) to Nx(end), or
      in-plane shear load Nxy varying from Nxy(beg) to Nxy(end),
      depending on the value you selected for ICURV.

959.1 Ending value for hoop load Ny, Ny(end)
959.2 
      Behavior and margins will be calculated for hoop load Ny
      varying from Ny(beg) to Ny(end) acting in combination with
      either axial load Nx varying from Nx(beg) to Nx(end), or
      in-plane shear load Nxy varying from Nxy(beg) to Nxy(end),
      depending on the value you selected for ICURV.

960.1 Starting value for in-plane shear load Nxy, Nxy(beg)
960.2 
      Behavior and margins will be calculated for shear load Nxy
      varying from Nxy(beg) to Nxy(end) acting in combination with
      either axial load Nx varying from Nx(beg) to Nx(end), or
      hoop load Ny varying from Ny(beg) to Ny(end), depending on
      the value you selected for ICURV.

961.1 Ending value for in-plane shear load Nxy, Nxy(end)
961.2 
      Behavior and margins will be calculated for shear load Nxy
      varying from Nxy(beg) to Nxy(end) acting in combination with
      either axial load Nx varying from Nx(beg) to Nx(end), or
      hoop load Ny varying from Ny(beg) to Ny(end), depending on
      the value you selected for ICURV.

962.1 Do you want to use the default for the number of steps?
962.2 
      By number of steps is meant the number of combinations
      of (Nx,Ny) or (Nx,Nxy) or (Ny,Nxy) for which to calculate
      the behavior and the margins within the range you have
      just established.

      The default value of the number of steps, NSTEPS, is 27
      If you do not want the default value, use a value for
      NSTEPS that is less than 27

963.1 Number of steps from N(beg) to N(end): NSTEPS
963.2 
      NSTEPS must be less than or equal to 27   .

964.1 Normal pressure in STAGS model in Load Set A, p
964.2 
      If the panel is curved, the normal pressure p must be
      consistent with the applied hoop resultant Ny:
      p*r = Ny, in which r = cylindrical shell radius.
      (r is always positive).

965.1 Normal pressure in STAGS model in Load Set B, p0
965.2

      (r is always positive).

966.1 Number of finite elements between adjacent sub-stringers

      If you are using the 410 finite element, make this
      at least two.

967.1 Number of finite elements between adjacent sub-rings
967.2
      If you are using the 410 finite element, make this
      at least two.

968.1 Number of nodes over height of sub-stringer web, NPSUBS
968.2 
      Generally use a small number such as 3 . Substringers are
      of rectangular cross section.

      Use an odd number.

969.1 Number of nodes over height of sub-ring web, NPSUBR
969.2 Generally use a small number such as 3 . Subrings are
      of rectangular cross section.

      Use an odd number.

970.0 
      You will next be asked to provide local initial imperfections:
      1. Do you want to include local imperfections in the STAGS model?
         (These will be in the form of buckling modes obtained by you
          in previous runs of STAGS for this case. You may provide up
          to 30 buckling modal imperfections.)
      2. For the ith buckling modal imperfection, you must provide:
         2(a) an amplitude factor, WIMPL(i). (may be + or -).
         2(b) a STAGS run number, IRUN(i). (Consult the *.out2 STAGS
              output file).
         2(c) a load step number, ISTEP(i). (0 for linear buckling;
              n for nonlinear buckling, where n is less than the
              highest load step already processed for this case).
         2(d) a mode number, IMODE((ISTEP(i)). (must be greater than 0
              and less than or equal to the number of buckling modes
              previously calculated for load step ISTEP(i).)

971.1 Do you want to provide initial imperfection(s)?
971.2 
      If you have, in a previous run or runs, obtained buckling modes
      via INDIC = 1, 3 or 4, you can answer Y. If this is the
      first STAGS run for this case, answer N.

972.1 Amplitude of initial buckling modal imperfection, WIMPL
972.2 
      May be either positive or negative. Usually it is a good idea
      to choose ABS(WIMPL) less than about 0.1 times the wall
      thickness midway between stiffeners. Note that the sign may be
      very important.

973.1 Run number for which this buckling mode was computed, IRUN
973.2 
      By "Run number" is meant the number of the STAGS run for which
      eigenvalues and buckling modes were computed in previous run(s).
      If you are unsure, consult the (name).out2 file in which the
      modes were computed from which you are now selecting imperfection
      shapes. To find the run number, search for the string:

                      EIGENVECTOR:

      in the (name).out2 file. ("name" represents your name for this
      case.)  You will see the line:

                 EIGENVECTOR:  RUN  n,  LOAD STEP  m,  PA=    ...etc.

      in which n is the run number that you want and m is the load
      step number, which is asked for next.

974.1 Load step number at which this buckling mode was computed, ISTEP
974.2 
      ISTEP must be 0 for buckling modes calculated from linear theory,
      that is, with INDIC = 1.  Again, consult the appropriate
      (name).out2 file from the appropriate STAGS run if you don't
      know or remember the load step number in the run IRUN.

975.1 Mode number at the load step ISTEP of the run IRUN: IMODE
975.2 
      Must be less than or equal to the highest mode previously
      computed in the run IRUN and at the load step ISTEP.

976.1 Do you want to provide another imperfection?
976.2 
      You can provide up to a total of 30 modal imperfections. They
      can come from any previous run in which you calculated buckling
      modes. 

977.1 Number of nodes over height of stiffener webs, NODWEB
977.2 
      You must provide an odd integer.

      First try a small number such as 3. In a convergence study,
      or with models in which the cylindrical shell does not have
      a huge number of nodes (huge = 500000 or more), or with models
      in which there are not many stiffeners, you can try more,
      especially if you suspect that significant web bending occurs
      during buckling and/or nonlinear collapse. In STAGSUNIT the
      webs of both stringers and rings will have the same number of
      nodal points over their heights.

978.1 Sub-stringer model, ISTRSB = 1 or 2 or 3 (Type H(elp))
978.2 
      ISTRSB = 1 means that sub-stringers are smeared out.
      ISTRSB = 2 means that sub-stringers are modelled as discrete beams.
      ISTRSB = 3 means that sub-stringers are modelled as shell branches.

979.1 Sub-ring model, IRNGSB = 1 or 2 or 3 (Type H(elp))
979.2
      IRNGSB = 1 means that sub-rings are smeared out.
      IRNGSB = 2 means that sub-rings are modelled as discrete beams.
      IRNGSB = 3 means that sub-rings are modelled as shell branches.

980.0 
      You will next be asked to provide initial velocity modes:
      1. Do you want to include initial velocity modes in the STAGS model?
         (These will be in the form of buckling modes obtained by you
          in previous runs of STAGS for this case. You may provide up
          to 30 initial velocity modes.)
      2. For the ith initial velocity mode, you must provide:
         2(a) an amplitude factor, VELOC(i). (may be + or -).
         2(b) a STAGS run number, IMRUN(i). (Consult the *.out2 STAGS
              output file).
         2(c) a load step number, IMSTEP(i). (0 for linear buckling;
              n for nonlinear buckling, where n is less than or equal the
              highest load step already processed for this case).
         2(d) a mode number, IMMODE((IMSTEP(i)). (must be greater than 0
              and less than or equal to the number of buckling modes
              previously calculated for load step IMSTEP(i).)

981.1 Do you want to provide initial velocity mode(s)?
981.2 
      If you have, in a previous run or runs, obtained buckling modes
      via INDIC = 1, 3, or 4, you can answer Y. If this is the
      first STAGS run for this case, answer N.

982.1 Amplitude of initial velocity  mode, VELOC
982.2 
      May be either positive or negative. Usually it is a good idea
      to choose ABS(VELOC) less than about 0.1 times the wall
      thickness midway between stiffeners. Note that the sign may be
      very important.

983.1 Run number for which this buckling mode was computed, IMRUN
983.2 
      By "Run number" is meant the number of the STAGS run for which
      eigenvalues and buckling modes were computed in previous run(s).
      If you are unsure, consult the (name).out2 file in which the
      modes were computed from which you are now selecting imperfection
      shapes. To find the run number, search for the string:

                      EIGENVECTOR:

      in the (name).out2 file. ("name" represents your name for this
      case.)  You will see the line:

                 EIGENVECTOR:  RUN  n,  LOAD STEP  m,  PA=    ...etc.

      in which n is the run number that you want and m is the load
      step number, which is asked for next.

984.1 Load step number at which this buckling mode was computed, IMSTEP
984.2 
      IMSTEP must be 0 for buckling modes calculated from linear theory,
      that is, with INDIC = 1.  Again, consult the appropriate
      (name).out2 file from the appropriate STAGS run if you don't
      know or remember the load step number in the run IMRUN.

985.1 Mode number at the load step IMSTEP of the run IMRUN: IMMODE
985.2 
      Must be less than or equal to the highest mode previously
      computed in the run IMRUN and at the load step IMSTEP.

986.1 Do you want to provide another initial velocity mode?
986.2 
      You can provide up to a total of 30 initial velocity modes. They
      can come from any previous run in which you calculated buckling
      modes. 

987.1 Number of stringers in STAGS model of 360-deg. cylinder
987.2 
      The first stringer is at circ. angle, theta = 0 degrees
      and the last stringer is at theta=(360-dtheta), in which
      dtheta is the circ. angle between the lines of attachment
      of adjacent stringers.

      NOTE: Make sure that the stringer spacing is equal to
            the PANDA2 variable called B(1), or B(STR). You
            may have to run PANDA2 again with B(1) set so that
            there are exactly the right number of uniformly spaced
            stringers in the complete (360-deg.) cylindrical shell.

988.1 Number of rings in the STAGS model of the panel
988.2 
      The first ring may be at the beginning of the panel 
      or it may be one-half ring spacing in from this edge,
      depending on how you answer the next question. 

      NOTE: Make sure that the ring spacing is equal to the PANDA2
            variable called B(2), or B(RNG). You may have to run
            PANDA2 again with B(2) set so that there are exactly
            the right number of uniformly spaced rings over the
            axial length in the STAGS model. Alternatively, you
            may have to change the axial length of the STAGS model.

989.1 Are there rings at the ends of the panel?
989.2 
      If your answer Y the number of rings you just supplied will
      include rings at each end of the panel. The ring spacing
      will be equal to XSTAGS/(no. of rings - 1), in which
      XSTAGS is the axial length of the STAGS model.

      If you answer N the first and last rings will be located
      one-half a ring spacing from each end. The ring spacing
      will be equal to XSTAGS/(no. of rings).

990.1 Number of finite elements between adjacent stringers
990.2 
      If you are using the 410 finite element, make this
      at least two.

      NOTE: If you answer 0 PANDA2 will ask you to provide
      the number of finite elements in the circumferential
      direction. In such a case the stringers must be
      smeared out.

991.1 Number of finite elements between adjacent rings
991.2 
      If you are using the 410 finite element, make this
      at least two.

      NOTE: If you answer 0 PANDA2 will ask you to provide
      the number of finite elements in the axial 
      direction. In such a case the rings must be
      smeared out and the nodal point spacing in the
      axial direction must be uniform.

992.1 Stringer model: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5(Type H(elp))
992.2  
      Input must be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5

            1 = all stringer segments are modeled as beams (210
                elements) that are attached to the cyl. shell.

            2 = stringer webs are modeled as shell branches (410 or 480)
                and any faying and/or outstanding flanges are modelled
                as beams (210 elements). The faying flanges are attached
                to the cylindrical shell and the outstanding flanges are
                attached at the tips of the stringer webs.

            3 = all stringer segments are modeled as shell branches.

            4 = stringer faying flange is modeled as beam (210 elements),
                but stringer web and stringer outstanding flange are
                modeled as shell branches.

            5 = the stringers are replaced by enforcement of a constraint
                that the normal displacement w be constant along the
                generator where the stringer would be attached to the
                cylindrical shell.

993.1 Ring model: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 (Type H(elp))
993.2 
      Input must be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5:

            1 = all ring segments are modeled as beams (210 elements)
                that are attached to the cylindrical shell.

            2 = ring webs are modeled as shell branches (410 or 480)
                and any faying and/or outstanding flanges are modelled
                as beams (210 elements). The faying flanges are attached
                to the cylindrical shell and the outstanding flanges are
                attached at the tips of the ring webs.

            3 = all ring segments are modeled as shell branches.

            4 = ring faying flange is modeled as beam (210 elements),
                but ring web and ring outstanding flange are
                modeled as shell branches.

            5 = the rings are replaced by enforcement of a constraint
                that the normal displacement w be constant along the
                circumference where the ring would be attached to the
                cylindrical shell.

994.1 Reference surface of cyl: 1=outer, 0=middle, -1=inner
994.2 
      Choose either 1 or 0 or -1
      If the stringers are external you may want to choose  1
      If the stringers are internal you may want to choose -1
      If the height of the stringers is large compared to
      the thickness of the cyl. shell, you should choose    0
      If you are planning to use fasteners, please choose 0

995.1 Do you want to use fasteners (they are like rigid links)?
995.2 
      Usually you should answer N. However, if at the optimum
      design the height of the stringers is not large compared
      to the thickness of the cylindrical shell, and if you
      answered 0 to the previous question about location of the
      reference surface of the cylindrical shell. then you might
      want to answer Y. Note that the use of fasteners
      approximately numerically doubles the size of the case.

      Fasteners are used to permit a gap between the reference
      surface of the cylindrical shell and the roots of the
      stringers and rings (when these stiffeners are modelled
      as shell branches rather than as beams).

      The fasteners act like tiny springs between "fastened" nodes.
      The fastener spring constant is chosen automatically by
      STAGSUNIT. It is set rather high in order that fasteners
      act in a manner similar to rigid links.

996.1 Are the stringers to be "smeared out"?
996.2 
      Generally, you should answer N.

997.1 Are the rings to be "smeared out"?
997.2 
      Generally, you should answer N.

998.1 Do you want to use the "least-squares" model for torque?
998.2 
      Usually you should answer "y". In STAGSUNIT models, torque
      is always applied at x = 0. There are two choices:

      1. STAGSUNIT can simply apply the appropriate value of Nxy at
         x = 0 as one of the loading components in Shell Unit No. 1.

      2. STAGSUNIT can apply a torque about what the STAGS manual
         calls a "user-defined point". (This "user-defined point" is
         always located at the origin of the global coordinate system,
         (Xg,Yg,Zg)=(0,0,0) in STAGS models created via STAGSUNIT.)

      Given the choice of one of the two options, STAGSUNIT
      automatically generates the proper input data for STAGS.
      The user of STAGSUNIT does not need to worry about the 
      details of the modeling.

      Option 2 is preferred because simple application of Nxy to the
      skin of the cylindrical shell at x = 0 generates, in nonlinear
      analyses, a small spurious hoop tension in a circumferential
      band of width approximately equal to a "boundary layer" width
      of about 2.0*SQRT(r*t) adjacent to x = 0. When you choose
      Option 2, STAGSUNIT automatically sets up a "user-defined" node
      at (Xg,Yg,Zg)=(0.,0.,0.) and sets up a finite element unit
      containing the torque, which is equal to Nxy*2*pi*r**2.
