                               PURPOSE OF DECIDE

               You provide, in a  conversationally  interactive  mode,
          strategy  parameters  for  PANDA2  optimization.  You choose
          which of the problem parameters are to be decision variables
          (allowed  to change) during optimization and their lower and
          upper bounds.  You also choose linked  parameters,  that  is
          parameters  that are not decision variables but vary in pro-
          portion with designated decision  variables,  and  you  assign
          factors  of  proportionality.   Finally, you choose "escape"
          variables, that is variables that should be increased during
          any design iteration in which CONMIN fails to change the de-
          sign.  You should choose only thicknesses  as  escape  vari-
          ables.   There is a default option for "escape" variables in
          which only decision variables that are thicknesses are  cho-
          sen.  You should use the default option.

               To repeat, there are three types of variables you  cho-
          ose in DECIDE:

               1.  DECISION VARIABLES .  .  .  .These variables change
          independently of each other during optimization.

               2.  LINKED VARIABLES .  .  .  .  .Each of  these  vari-
          ables is proportional to one of the decision variables.  You
          choose which one and you choose the factor of proportionali-
          ty.

               3.  ESCAPE VARIABLES .  .  .  .  .These  are  variables
          that,  when  increased, drive the design toward the feasible
          region.  An escape variable must be a decision variable  and
          should be a thickness.

          In addition, as of 23 Feb., 1989, you may introduce inequality
          constraints that involve several design variables. A complete
          description appears in the PROMPT.DAT file, Items 595 - 650.
          Part of this description is repeated in the PANDA2.NEW file,
          Item 29.

               Your interactive input is saved on a file, NAME.DEC, in
          which  NAME is the same name you used for BEGIN, SETUP, etc.
          In future runs of this or a similar case, you can  edit  the
          file  NAME.DEC,  then  give the command DECIDE, and tell the
          system that you are using an existing  file.   If  you  goof
          part  way  through  a case, you can do a CONTROL Y, edit the
          NAME.DEC file, and re-issue the command DECIDE, telling  the
          system  that you are adding to an existing file.  The system
          will answer all the questions up to your goof in  a  "batch"
          mode, then return control to you.  You can then complete the
          interactive input.

               Output from the PANDA2 processor DECIDE is stored in  a
          file with the name NAME.OPD.  You should print this file and
          inspect it to make sure that the case is as you intend it to
          be.

      EXAMPLE OF USE OF  DECIDE  IN A RUNSTREAM:
 
            BEGIN          (you establish a starting design)
            SETUP          (system sets up an input file for BOSOR4)
            BOSMODEL       (system sets up BOSOR4-type discrete models)
            DECIDE         (you establish optimization parameters)
            MAINSETUP      (you set up loads and analysis strategy to be
                            used by PANDAOPT)
            PANDAOPT       (system performs PANDA2 optimization)
