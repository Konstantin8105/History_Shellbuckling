                  1.0     PURPOSE OF PANDA2 

      The purpose of PANDA2 is to find the minimum weight design
      of a stiffened flat or curved panel or complete cylindrical
      shell made of laminated composite material. Of course,
      simple isotropic panels and cylindrical shells can also  be
      designed. 

      The  panel  can  be  loaded by up to 5 independent sets of
      in-plane loads and normal pressure, Nx, Ny, Nxy, and p, 
      in which Nx is the load in the axial direction.  PANDA2
      represents a more detailed treatment of  certain  behavior
      not  handled by PANDA [1].  In particular, optimum designs
      can be obtained for panels with locally post-buckled  skin
      and for panels with hat stiffeners.  In addition,   PANDA2
      will handle nonlinear static response to  normal pressure,
      panels with nonuniform axial loading, and imperfect panels.






          2.0     WHAT CAN PANDA2 DO THAT PANDA CANNOT DO?

      1. More variation in panel cross section (e.g. thickened
         stiffener bases) 
      2. Better local buckling predictions thru use of
         discretized cross section 
      3. Analysis and design of locally imperfect and/or locally
         postbuckled panels 
      4. General instability in cases where axial load varies
         across the panel 
      5. Nonlinear static response to normal pressure 
      6. Design for multiple sets of in-plane loads and normal
         pressure 
      7. Residual stresses and deformations from curing effects
         can be included 
      8. Stresses in layers of laminated stiffener parts are
         determined 
      9. Hat-stiffened panels, or semi-sandwich corrugated panels
         included

                        UNDER COMBINED IN-PLANE LOADS
      ====================================================================







                  4.0    DEFINITION OF "PANEL"

      A panel is defined here as a structure that is either flat
      or is part of a cylinder. In most cases the user will
      probably want to analyze a flat panel or a panel that spans
      less than about 20 degrees of circumference.  However, in
      PANDA2 complete cylindrical shells can be treated by the
      user's setting up a model of a panel that spans 180
      degrees. The buckling loads given by PANDA2 for half of a
      cylindrical shell are the same as those given in the
      literature for a complete cylindrical shell because:

         1. the panel is assumed by PANDA2
            to be  simply supported along its straight edges, and

         2. a deep cylindrical panel
            spanning  180 degrees of circumference with simple supports
            along the generators at 0 and at 180  degrees behaves in
            the same way as a complete cylindrical shell:  The number
            of circumferential half-waves in the 180-degree panel  in
            the critical general instability buckling pattern is the
            same  as the number of full circumferential waves in the
            360-degree cylindrical  shell. 

      In PANDA2 the curved edges of a cylindrical panel lie in
      the plane of the screen (axial coordinate x = 0) and
      parallel to the plane of the screen (axial coordinate x =
      L, where L is the length of the panel). The axial
      coordinate direction x is normal to the plane of the screen
      and pointing out of the screen.  Thus, an axial load on the
      panel is normal to the screen, with axial tension pointing
      out of the screen. 

      The width of the panel is the arc length along the curved
      edge. For example, the width of a deep cylindrical panel
      spanning 180 degrees is pi*R, where R is the radius of
      curvature. The coordinate in the width direction is called
      y. In the following, this direction is referred to with use
      of the words "circumferential" or "hoop" or
      "transverse". 

      The properties of the panel are assumed to be uniform in
      the axial (x) direction and periodic in the circumferential
      (y) direction. The panel may be unstiffened, stiffened by
      stringers alone, stiffened by rings alone, or stiffened by
      both rings and stringers. Stiffeners referred to as
      "stringers" are always normal to the screen; stiffeners
      referred to as "rings" always lie in the plane of the
      screen or parallel to the plane of the screen.  Both
      stringers and rings must be uniformly spaced. All stringers
      must be the same.  All rings must be the same. The rings
      can be different from the stringers. 






                    5.0   TYPES OF STIFFENERS
 
      PANDA2 can handle panels with stringers and/or rings with
      the following cross sections: 

           1. T-shaped
           2. J-shaped (angle with flange away from skin)
           3. rectangular (blade stiffeners)
           4. hat-shaped or corrugated stiffeners

      The portion of the panel skin near the stiffeners can have
      different properties than those of the panel skin away from
      the stiffeners. For example, optimum designs of panels with
      T-shaped stringers have thickened bases under the stringers
      that help to prevent fracture or delamination along the
      attachment line of the stringer to the skin. Figures 1 and
      2 show an example of a flat panel with T-shaped stringers. 







                 6.0     BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

      In the PANDA2 system the panel is assumed to be simply
      supported along the two edges normal to the plane of the
      screen (at y = 0 and at y = panel width). The panel can be
      either simply supported or clamped along the other two
      boundaries (at x = 0 and x = L), but the conditions must be
      the same at both of these two boundaries.  The PANDA2
      analysis is always performed for simple support on all four
      edges.  However, experience has shown that clamping at x =
      0 and at x = L can be simulated by the analysis of a
      shorter simply supported panel: A panel clamped at x = 0
      and x = L has general instability loads approximately equal
      to those of a panel simply supported at x = 0 and x =
      L/sqrt(3.85). Therefore, in PANDA2, clamping at x = 0 and x
      = L is simulated by calculation of general instability or
      wide column instability of a simply supported panel with
      length equal to L/sqrt(3.85). 

      In PANDA2 local buckling behavior and local stress
      concentrations near stiffeners are assumed to be
      independent of the boundary conditions along the four panel
      edges.  This is a good assumption if there are more than
      two or three halfwaves in the local buckling pattern over
      the length and width of the entire panel. 







                       7.0    LOADING

      The  panel  can  be  loaded by up to five independent sets
      of in-plane loads, Nx, Ny, and Nxy, and normal pressure.
      Buckling loads, postbuckling behavior, and maximum stresses
      are calculated for each of the five load sets applied by
      itself.  Optimization is global, that is, PANDA2 determines
      the best design that is capable of surviving all of the
      five load sets when each set is applied separately, as it
      would be during different phases of a panel's lifetime.
      Associated with each of the five independent load sets,
      there can be two load subsets, Load Set A and Load Set B.
      Load Set A consists of what are termed in the PANDA2 output
      as "eigenvalue loads": These are loads that are to be
      multiplied by the critical buckling load factor
      (eigenvalue). Load Set B consists of loads that are not
      multiplied by the critical buckling load factor. Stated
      mathematically, the critical load is given by 

        Ncr = N(load set B) +(buckling load factor)*N(load set A)
 
      The following table lists the components and properties
      of the loading in PANDA2:

       ==================================================================







                     8.0    TYPES OF ANALYSIS
 
      PANDA2 performs the following analyses:



         8.1 CONSTITUTIVE LAW:

            a. PANDA2 obtains the integrated
               constitutive law  [the 6x6 matrix C(i,j)] for each segment
               of a panel module (Figs. 1 and 2). 

            b. It obtains thermal resultants and
               strains from  curing for each segment of a panel module. 
 
            c. It obtains the integrated
               constitutive law  [the 6x6 matrix Cs(i,j)] for the panel
               with either and both sets of  stiffeners "smeared out".
               ("Smearing out" the stiffeners means  averaging their
               properties over the entire area of the panel.  See  Eqs.
               (40) of Ref. [7], for example.) 

            d. It obtains the thermal forces and
               moments  and residual deformations of a panel in which skin
               and stiffeners  have been cocured. 

            e. It obtains the tangent stiffness
               CTAN(i,j) of the  panel skin and of the stiffener
               webs and flanges in their locally deformed
               states.

            f. It obtains the tangent stiffness
               CSTAN(i,j) of the  panel with locally deformed, smeared
               stiffeners, using CTAN(i,j) for the stiffness of the 
               locally deformed panel skin. 




         8.2  EQUILIBRIUM:

            a. PANDA2 obtains bowing of the
               panel due to curing. 

            b. It obtains static response of the
               panel to  uniform normal pressure, using NONLINEAR theory. 
               Two problems are  solved: 

               i. overall static response of
                  entire panel  with smeared stiffeners, and 

              ii. local static response of a
                  single panel  module with a discretized cross section
                  (Fig. 1).

            c. Average strain and resultant
               distribution  in all of the panel parts (Fig. 1) are
               determined for: 

               i. the panel loaded by all loads
                  except normal  pressure. The effect of bowing of the panel
                  due to both  curing and normal pressure is included. 

              ii. the panel loaded by normal
                      pressure. 

            d. Stresses in material coordinates in  each layer in each
               laminate of the panel module (Fig.1) are  calculated for the
               perfect (IQUICK = 1) or for the locally deformed
               (IQUICK = 0) panel. If IQUICK = 0 (discretized panel module
               model used for the local buckling analysis) the
               panel is always locally deformed, even for zero load,
               because it is assumed to be imperfect, with the imperfection
               shape being the same as that of the local bifurcation
               buckling mode and the initial imperfection amplitude being
               supplied by the program user.

            e. Tensile forces in parts of the
               stiffener  web(s) that tend to pull the web from the panel
               skin are calculated,  and these forces are compared to a
               maximum allowable "peel force" that  the user has
               previously obtained from peel tests on sample coupons that 
               bear some similarity to the concept for which he or she is
               seeking an  optimum design. 






         8.3  BUCKLING:

            a. PANDA2 obtains buckling load
               factors from a PANDA-type  of analysis (closed form, see
               Refs. [1] and [7]) for general  instability, local
               buckling, crippling, rolling of stiffeners. 

            b. It obtains the load factor for
               local skin  buckling from a BOSOR4-type [2] of analysis in
               which the cross section of  a single panel module is
               discretized [Figs. 1, 2, 20(a,b), 22(a,b)]. 

            c. It obtains a load factor for wide
               column  buckling from a BOSOR4-type of analysis of a
               discretized single panel module  [Figs. 2, 20(c), 22(c)]. 

            d. It obtains a load factor for
               general  instability from a BOSOR4-type of analysis of the
               entire panel with  smeared stiffeners. The width of the
               panel is discretized. 







                     9.0   MODELS USED IN PANDA2

         9.1 Model type 1 

         Included are PANDA-type models [1]  for general,  local, 
         and panel buckling,  crippling of stiffener parts, and
         rolling of stiffeners with and without participation of the
         panel skin.  These models are described in detail in [1]. 
         (See Table 1 and Figs.  1-4 of [1].) (Numbers [i] refer to
         references given below.) 

         9.2 Model type 2 

         Buckling load factors and post-local buckling behavior 
         are  calculated  for  what  is  termed in PANDA2 a "panel
         module."  Such a module is depicted in Figs.  1 and 2.   A
         module  includes  the cross section of a stiffener plus
         the panel skin of width equal to the spacing  between
         stiffeners.   In this model the panel module cross section
         is divided into segments, each of which is discretized and
         analyzed   via   the   finite  difference  energy  method
         [2]. Variation of deflection in the axial direction is 
         assumed to  be  harmonic[  sin(n*x)   or   cos(n*x)  ].  
         This one-dimensional discretization is similar to that
         used  in the  BOSOR  programs for the analysis of shells of
         revolution [2]. In fact, many of the subroutines for 
         buckling  and vibration  analysis  are  taken  from  BOSOR4
         and modified slightly.  The modification is necessary to 
         handle  prismatic  structures  instead  of shells of
         revolution. 

         Both local and wide-column instability can be handled with
         the same discretized structural model. Symmetry conditions
         are applied at the left and right edges  of  the single
         module model, that is, symmetry conditions are applied
         midway between stringers. 

          The single module model gives a good approximation to the
         local skin buckling mode if there are more than three or
         four equally spaced stringers in the panel.  What goes on
         locally between interior stringers in a panel, stringers
         which are rotating about their axes only, not bending,  is
         only weakly affected by the boundary conditions at panel
         edges that may be several bays away. 
  
          The wide column buckling model in PANDA2 is applied to an
         axial length of panel between adjacent rings, or if there
         are no rings, to the entire axial length of the panel, L.
         The wide-column buckling load predicted from the single
         panel module is always lower and usually reasonably close
         to the general instability load of the entire width of the
         panel between rings because the axial bending stiffness of
         a stringer-stiffened panel is usually much, much greater
         than the transverse bending stiffness of the portion of the
         panel between adjacent rings. Hence, the strain energy in
         the buckled panel, and therefore the buckling behavior, is
         only weakly dependent on bending of the panel transverse to
         the stringers. Therefore, the boundary conditions along the
         edges of the panel parallel to the stringers are not
         important.  On the other hand, local bending of the skin
         and local deformation of the stringer parts in the wide
         column buckling mode may significantly affect the wide
         column buckling load.  These effects are not included in
         the closed-form PANDA-type model of general instability,
         but they are included in the single panel module model of
         wide column buckling. 

         9.3 Model type 3 

         Also included in the PANDA2 collection of models is a
         discretized model of the entire  width  of  the panel, 
         treated  in  this case with stiffeners smeared out. This
         model is introduced only if  the  axial  load  varies
         across the width of the panel or if there exists normal
         pressure.

                   11.0  OVERALL PHILOSOPHY

      The overall philosophy of PANDA2 is to use several separate
      relatively simple models to capture different phenomena,
      rather than use a single multi-dimensionally discretized
      finite element model with a large number of degrees of
      freedom. The aim is to produce a program that can yield
      optimum designs of rather sophisticated panels that
      experience very complex and very nonlinear behavior, and to
      do this without the use of large, general-purpose programs
      and their elaborate data base management systems. 

      For example, PANDA-type models (Model type 1) are used in
      PANDA2 to obtain quick, preliminary designs which one can
      then use as starting designs in optimization analyses based
      on the more elaborate discretized panel module model. Also,
      PANDA-type models are used to obtain buckling load factors
      in cases for which the discretized panel module model is
      not applicable, to obtain knockdown factors for the effect
      of in-plane shear loading, to obtain preliminary estimates
      of how much growth in any initial panel bowing to expect
      under compressive in--plane loads, and to check if it is
      likely that a curved panel with uniform external pressure
      will collapse under the pressure acting by itself. 

      Models of type 2 (single discretized module) and type 3
      (discretization of entire width with smeared stiffeners)
      are used in tandem to obtain from nonlinear theory the
      complex behavior of a stiffened plate or shell loaded by
      normal pressure. Model type 3 is the only one that is valid
      if the axial load varies across the width of the panel. 
 
      In the panels designed by  PANDA2  the  skin  between
      stringers  may deform locally and buckle  well before failure
      of the entire panel. If the IQUICK = 0 option is used
      in MAINSETUP, the skin and stringer parts are considered
      to be locally deformed, with the shape of this local
      deformation being the same as the local bifurcation
      buckling mode predicted by PANDA2 and the initial amplitude
      of the local deformation being chosen by the user.
      The maximum stress components and  therefore  stress 
      constraints in the optimization analysis are computed
      including growth and modification of the local deformation
      pattern due to application of the loads. This growth and
      modification  of the local deformation pattern is predicted
      by a modified version of a theory formulated by Koiter in 1946 [4].
      Model type 2 (single discretized module) is the only model in
      PANDA2 valid for this complicated nonlinear analysis. 

      After the optimum design is obtained, the user can, if no
      in--plane shear load is applied, check the accuracy of the
      general instability load predicted from the single-module
      model by running a multi--module model with BOSOR4 [2]. 
      The input data file  for  this multi--module model is 
      generated automatically by the PANDA2 system. 







            12.0   ARCHITECTURE OF THE PANDA2 SYSTEM

      As with PANDA, the program PANDA2 consists of several
      independently  executable  processors which share a common
      data base.  In the processor BEGIN the user supplies  a 
      starting design  (perhaps  a  design produced by PANDA). 
      In DECIDE he or she chooses decision variables for  the 
      optimization  analysis and their upper and lower bounds,
      linking variables and their factors of  proportionality,  
      and "escape" variables (explained in DECIDE). In
      MAINSETUP the user chooses up to five sets of combined
      in--plane loads and normal pressure; factors of safety for
      general instability, local instability, and material
      failure; strategy parameters such as number and range  of 
      axial  half--waves  in  the local buckling mode; and number
      of design iterations in the  optimization  problem. The
      command  PANDAOPT initiates a batch run of the PANDA2
      mainprocessor, which consists of two main branches:  in one
      branch the structural analyses (stress, buckling and post--
      buckling)  are  performed and in the other new designs are
      produced by the optimizer CONMIN, written by Vanderplaats
      [3]. 







         13.0   HOW TO OPERATE THE PANDA2 SYSTEM OF PROGRAMS 

      To operate PANDA2 you must have the BOSOR4 program system
      on a subdirectory with the name BOSOR4.  The PANDA2 system
      uses many of the libraries from the BOSOR4 system,  and
      certain  commands  (for  example PANEL followed by
      BOSORALL)  use BOSOR4 processors directly. 

      You first activate PANDA2 commands via the command
      PANDA2LOG.  This command must be given before you do any
      PANDA2 work. 
 
      You then prepare input data interactively via the BEGIN
      command.   These  data establish a starting design,
      material  properties, and  temperature  rise  pertaining to
      residual  stresses  from  curing.   The data that you
      provide interactively are stored on a file NAME.BEG, which
      you  will  find  very  useful  in future analyses of the
      same design concept.  (NAME is a name that you choose and
      retain for  the  entire case.) 

      You next type the command SETUP.  As a result of SETUP, a
      BOSOR4--type  of  input  data  file is created. Following
      SETUP, you type the command BOSMODEL.  This launches a
      batch  run  of a BOSOR4--type preprocessor which is almost
      identical  to BOSORREAD (see HELP4 PROGRAMS in the  BOSOR4
      subdirectory and Ref. [2], last citation). 

      The BOSMODEL processor creates a discretized model of a
      single module of the panel (see Fig.  1) and a discretized
      model of the entire panel with smeared stiffeners.  When
      the BOSMODEL  batch run is finished, you can either type
      the command  DECIDE  or  the  command MAINSETUP.  If you
      choose DECIDE, you  will be asked to pick decision
      variables and their upper and  lower  bounds,  linked
      variables and linking constants, and  escape variables.  If
      you  choose MAINSETUP,  you  will  be  asked  to  provide
      loads, factors of safety, and strategy parameters for a
      simple buckling  analysis of a fixed design. 
 
      Suppose you choose DECIDE.  This choice means that  you
      intend  to do an optimization analysis.  After picking
      decision variables and other optimization parameters in
      DECIDE,  you  type  the command MAINSETUP.  Now you provide
      up to five sets of combined in--plane loads, normal
      pressure, and factors of safety for general instability,
      local instability, and material failure, and you establish
      certain  strategy parameters for the buckling and
      optimization  analyses. 

      You then type the command PANDAOPT,  which  launches  a
      batch run of the PANDA2 mainprocessor.  Simple buckling
      analyses require up to several minutes on the VAX 11/780,
      and 6  to  10 design iterations in an optimization analysis
      require  about  3 to 30 minutes of CPU time.  The results
      of the  PANDAOPT run are stored in a file called NAME.OPM. 

      After inspecting the NAME.OPM file, you may wish to  do
      more  design iterations.  If you feel that the loads,
      factors of safety, and strategy parameters established in
      MAINSETUP are still good, simply type  the  command
      PANDAOPT again.  Look at the new NAME.OPM file.  Keep
      repeating this cycle until you think you have an  optimum
      design.  If along the way you want to change the strategy
      parameters, type MAINSETUP again. If you want to  change 
      which  parameters  are  decision variables or upper or
      lower  bounds, or if you want to change the  linking 
      variables  or  linking constants of proportionality, type
      DECIDE again. 

      When you are satisfied that you have a good design, you
      will  probably  want plots of the cross section and
      buckling  modes.  You must first give the command MAINSETUP
      again  and  set  up a case in which you are analyzing a
      given design (no  optimization).  When the system  asks  if
      you  want  plots,  answer  Y.  After you finish with
      MAINSETUP, give the command PLOTTER. 

      All the analysis up to this point is for a single panel
      module  or  the  complete  panel in which the stiffeners
      are  smeared out.  You may want to check the accuracy  of 
      the  simplified  models  for  general instability 
      (PANDA--type or discretized models in  which the 
      stiffeners  are smeared out, and a wide--column discrete
      model which covers only a single panel module). This you do
      by  obtaining  the  general instability load factor for a
      multi--module discretized model that represents the entire
      panel, not just  a  single  module of  the panel.  You type
      the commands PANEL,  BOSOR4LOG, BOSORALL, and BOSORPLOT, in
      that order.  PANEL is analogous  to SETUP:   It  sets  up 
      an  input  data file,  NAME.ALL, for a multi--module
      discretized panel. This  file  is  a regular BOSOR4 input
      data file.  The command BOSOR4LOG  activates the BOSOR4
      command set, and the  command  BOSORALL initiates  a  batch
      run of the BOSOR4 pre--, main--, and postprocessors.  
      BOSORPLOT gets  plots  of   the discretized  multi--module
      panel and of the buckling modes. The PANEL processor should
      not be used if there exists significant in--plane applied
      shear load, Nxy.  BOSOR4 works for prismatic
      structures, such as an axially stiffened flat panel,
      through a "trick" described in Chapter 7 of Ref. [30].

                      *****  PLEASE NOTE *****

      The term "winding angle" is used throughout PANDA2. However,
      PANDA2 assumes that the composite laminates are "laid up"
      layer by layer, with each layer having a distinct and constant
      angle between the axial direction (normal to the screen) and
      the direction of the fibers (high modulus direction). Hence,
      the composite structure is not wound but built up
      layer by layer.  Fig. 2 of the journal article on PANDA shows
      the geometry. (See Ref. [1].)
