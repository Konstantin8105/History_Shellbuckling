80.1  Have any data already been provided by you for this case?
85.1  Have the data for all of the segments been provided by you?
90.1  What segment number is this? (provide in increasing order)
95.1  Have the data for boundary conditions been provided by you?
100.0 
      The following input must be provided by you for each
      shell segment.  See p. 61 for a list of the types of
      input data required.

101.1 NMESH = number of node points (5 = min.; 98 = max.)
101.2  
      See p. 62-64 for additional information on the
      number and on the distribution of nodal points.
      Note that the maximum number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) for
      the entire structure is limited to 2000 for the axisymmetric
      nonlinear analysis, in which only u and w are present as
      unknowns, and 3000 for buckling, vibration, or linear
      nonsymmetric stress analysis, in which u, v, and w are
      present as unknowns.  Formulas for the number of d.o.f.
      appear on page 62 and are repeated here as follows:
      For axisymmetric analysis the total number of d.o.f. are:

      d.o.f.= 3*NSEG + 3*NCOND + SUM OVER NSEG [ (NMESH(ISEG)+2)*2 ]

      For nonaxisymmetric analysis:

      d.o.f.= 4*NSEG + 4*NCOND + SUM OVER NSEG [ (NMESH(ISEG)+2)*3 ]

      in which NSEG = number of segments; NCOND = number of boundary
      plus junction points; NMESH(ISEG) = number of nodes in Seg. ISEG

102.1 NTYPEH= control integer (1 or 3) for nodal point spacing
102.2 
       NTYPEH = 1 means variable spacing.
       NTYPEH = 3 means constant spacing.
      EXAMPLE....
      Suppose you have a segment with NMESH = 50, and you wish
      to concentrate nodal points at the beginning of the segment.
      The following input data could be used...
      ================================================================
        DATUM    NAME OF DATUM          MEANING
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
        50          NMESH       number of nodes in segment
         1          NTYPEH      NTYPEH = 1 means variable spacing
         4          NHVALU      number of callouts along the meridian 
         1          IHVALU(1)   nodal point number, first callout
        20          IHVALU(2)   nodal point number, second callout
        21          IHVALU(3)   nodal point number, third callout
        49          IHVALU(4)   nodal point number, fourth callout
       0.1          HVALU(1)    spacing between 1st and 2nd nodes
       0.1          HVALU(2)    spacing between 20th and 21st nodes
       1.0          HVALU(3)    spacing between 21st and 22nd nodes
       1.0          HVALU(4)    spacing between 49th and 50th nodes
      ===============================================================
102.3   
      In the above example IHVALU(i) are the nodal point callouts
      for nodal point spacing and HVALU(i) are the spacings between
      the callout and the next node.  Absolute values of the
      spacings are not required; only relative values are needed,
      such round numbers as 0.1, 1.0, or 0.2.  In BOSOR4 it is best
      to keep the spacing constant over many nodes and then change
      it abruptly, as is done in the above example, rather than to
      vary the spacing gradually over many nodes.

103.1 NHVALU= number of callouts for nodal point spacing
103.2 
      Minimum value of NHVALU is 2; maximum value is 50.
      You must include the first node as a callout point and
      the second-to-last node as a callout point.
      See p. 64 for an example with variable spacing.

104.1 IHVALU(I)= Ith callout for nodal point spacing, IHVALU
104.2  
      IHVALU(1) must be 1 and IHVALU(NHVALU) must be NMESH-1.
      Spacing will vary linearly between the callouts you provide.

105.1 HVALU=meridional arc length between nodal points,HVALU
105.2
      This is the arc length between the nodal point corres-
      ponding to the callout and the next nodal point.
      Absolute values are not required; only relative values
      are needed, such round numbers as 1.0, 0.5, and the like.
      BOSOR4 will automatically expand or contract the total
      arc length to match that generated in the geometry
      routines later.

110.0 
      Geometry of the current segment...
111.1 NSHAPE= indicator (1,2 or 4) for geometry of meridian
111.2  
      See p.66 for illustrations...
      NSHAPE = 1 means cylinder, cone, or plate (straight meridian)
      NSHAPE = 2 means spherical, toroidal, or ogival
                 (constant meridional curvature)
      NSHAPE = 3 not used
      NSHAPE = 4 means ellipsoidal or general shape (use with 
                 caution. If possible build up a complex shape
                 with use of NSHAPE = 1 and NSHAPE = 2 segments.

112.1 R1     = radius at beginning of segment (see p. 66)
112.2  
      See Fig. on p. 66
113.1 Z1     = global axial coordinate at beginning of segment
114.1 R2     = radius at end of segment
115.1 Z2     = global axial coordinate at end of segment
116.1 R1     = radius at beginning of segment (see p. 66)
116.2  
      See Figures on p. 66
117.1 Z1     = global axial coordinate at beginning of segment
118.1 R2     = radius at end of segment
119.1 Z2     = global axial coordinate at end of segment
120.1 RC     = radius from axis of rev. to center of curvature
120.2  
      See Figures on p. 66
121.1 ZC     = axial coordinate of center of curvature
122.1 SROT=indicator for direction of increasing arc (-1. or +1.)
122.2  
      See Figures on p. 66
      -1 means anticlockwise;  +1 means clockwise.

123.1 NST   = indicator for geometry: 1=general, 4=ellipsoid
124.1 NZRIN = number of input coordinates (use 50 or less)
125.1 Z(I)=global axial coord., Z of Ith input coordinate, Z
126.1 R(I)  =radial coordinate of Ith input coordinate, R
127.1 ZMAX  = length of half of axial axis of ellipsoid (p.66)
128.1 XMAX  = length of half of radial axis of ellipsoid
129.1 ZA    = axial distance to beginning of segment (p.66)
130.1 ZB    = axial distance to end of segment (p. 66)
131.1 ALPHAT= radial distance from axis of rev. to center.
131.2  
      See Figures on p. 66 for illustration of input.
      Note that ZA must be less than ZB.
      Note that if an ellipsoidal dome is at the top of the
      structure rather than at the bottom, as is shown in the
      middle of the three figures pertaining to NST = 4 on
      page 66, that ZA and ZB are greater than ZMAX (ZB would
      be 2.*ZMAX, for example, if the dome were closed at the
      top.)

132.1 ZGLOBL= global axial coordinate of the point ZA
132.2 
      Note from p. 66 that the axial coordinate of the beginning
      of the segment (the point ZA) is a local coordinate. That
      is, the value of ZA is relative to the dimensions of an
      ellipse with cross section dimensions (XMAX, ZMAX). What is
      wanted for ZGLOBL is the global value of the station ZA when
      the multi-segment shell of revolution is assembled.

      ZGLOBL is needed for proper calculation of the mass distribution
      of the assembled shell of revolution.

133.1 IMP   = indicator for imperfection (0=none, 1=some)
134.1 ITYPE = indicator (1 or 2 or 3) for type of imperfection
134.2  
      ITYPE = 1 means sinusoidal series with random amplitudes
                and wavelengths;
      ITYPE = 2 means pure sinusoidal.
      ITYPE = 3 means sum of pure sinusoidal (deterministic
                amplitudes and wavelengths of harmonics).

135.1 FM    = number of wavelengths to be included

139.1 W0    = amplitude of pure sinusoidal imperfection
140.1 WLNGTH= half-wavelength of pure sinusoidal imperfection
140.2  
      See p. 67 for more explanation. Note that imperfections
      should be of the order of the thickness or less.

141.1 NTYPEZ= control (1 or 3) for reference surface location
141.2  
      NTYPEZ = 1 means that the distance from the shell wall
      leftmost surface to the reference surface varies along
      the meridian.  By "leftmost" we mean as we face in the
      direction of increasing meridional arc length, s.  See
      the figure at the bottom of p. 66.
         
      NTYPEZ = 3 means that the distance from  the  leftmost
      surface of the wall to the reference surface is const-
      ant as we proceed along the meridian, s.

142.1 NZVALU= number of meridional callouts for ref. surf.
142.2  
      Range of NZVALU is 2 to 50.  You must include the beginning
      and the end of the meridian.
      EXAMPLE....
      The following example could correspond to the figure
      on the top of page 68:
      ==========================================================
        DATUM       NAME OF DATUM          MEANING
      ----------------------------------------------------------
          4             NZVALU     number of callouts
          2             NTYPE     callouts are axial coords.
        1.0             Z(1)      axial location of 1st callout
        1.5             Z(2)      axial location of 2nd callout
        1.8             Z(3)      axial location of 3rd callout
        3.0             Z(4)      axial location of 4th callout
        0.5             ZVAL(1)   ref. surf. loc. at 1st callout
        0.5             ZVAL(2)   ref. surf. loc. at 2nd callout
        0.9             ZVAL(3)   ref. surf. loc. at 3rd callout
        0.9             ZVAL(4)   ref. surf. loc. at 4th callout
      ==========================================================
      NTYPE, Z(i), and ZVAL(i) are defined next.

143.1 NTYPE = control for meaning of callout (2=z, 3=r)
143.2  
      See pp. 68-69 for discussion and examples.
      NTYPE = 2 means callouts for reference surface location
                relative to shell wall material will be axial
                coordinates;
      NTYPE = 3 means callouts will be radial coordinates.

144.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith callout, z
144.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

145.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith callout, r
145.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

146.1 ZVAL  = distance from leftmost surf. to ref. surf.,ZVAL
146.2  
      See the figures on p. 68 and the discussion on p. 69.

147.1 ZVAL  = distance from leftmost surf. to reference surf.
147.2  
      See the figures at the bottom of p. 66 and the top of
      p. 68.

148.1 NRINGS= number (max=20) of discrete rings in this segment
148.2  
      Up to 20 rings are permitted in one segment; up to 98
      rings in the entire structure.  If line loads are
      applied at some station, the user must supply a fake
      ring, even if no ring is actually present in the struct-
      ure at that point.  This is because all line loads are
      considered to act at discrete ring centroids.

149.1 NTYPE = control for identification of ring location (2=z, 3=r)
149.2  
      NTYPE = 2 means that locations of discrete rings will be
      identified by axial coordinates, z(i), i= 1, NRINGS;

      NTYPE = 3 means that locations of discrete rings will be
      identified by radial coordinates, r(i), i=1, NRINGS.

150.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith ring, z
150.2  
      Z(i)= axial coords. of ring attachment points, considered to be
      on the ref. surface. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

151.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith ring, r
151.2  
      R(i)= radial coords. of ring attachment points, considered to
      be on the ref. surface. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

152.1 NTYPER= type (0 or 1 or 2 or 4 or 5) of discrete ring no.
152.2  
      0 means fake ring, needed as a place to "hang" a line load
      1 means read in E, A, Iy, Ix, Ixy, E1, E2, GJ, RM (see p.70)
      2 means read in E, A, Is, In, Isn, ZC, SC, GJ, RM (see fig.)

                   E, NU, X1P, Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), and RM (see p.72)
      5 means read same quantities, but in the (s,n) rather than
        in the (x,y) axis system (see bottom of p. 70 for the two
        axis systems.)

153.1 E     = Young's modulus of ring no.
154.1 A     = cross section area of ring no.
155.1 Iy    = moment of inertia about y-axis (see fig. on p.70)
156.1 Ix    = moment of inertia about x-axis, ring no.
157.1 Ixy   = product of inertia, ring no.
158.1 E1    = radial component of ring eccentricity (see p. 70)
159.1 E2    = axial  component of ring eccentricity, ring no.
160.1 GJ    = torsional rigidity, ring no.
161.1 RM    = ring material density (alum=.0002535),ring no.
162.1 E     = Young's modulus of ring no.
163.1 A     = cross section area of ring no.
164.1 Is    = moment of inertia about s-axis (see fig. on p.70)
165.1 In    = moment of inertia aboun n-axis, ring no.
166.1 Isn   = product of inertia in the (s,n) axis system

170.1 RM    = ring material density (alum=.0002535),ring no.
171.1 L(1)  = length of ring segment no. 1 (p.72), ring no.
172.1 L(2)  = length of ring segment no. 2, ring no.
173.1 L(3)  = length of ring segment no. 3, ring no.
174.1 T(1)  = thickness of ring segment no. 1, ring no.

183.1 RM =ring matl density (e.g. alum.=.0002535), ring no.
190.1 K=elastic foundation modulus (e.g. lb/in**3)in this seg.
190.2 
      Should be zero unless the shell is supported by an elastic
      foundation. Winkler foundation is assumed.  A Winkler
      foundation reacts only normal to the shell surface; it is
      like an array of closely spaced springs oriented normal to
      the shell surface.  Units of the foundation stiffness, K,
      are force per length cubed (lb/in**3, for example).

192.0   
      The following input is related to loading of this
      segment.  Please see pp. 73-77 for discussion and
      definitions. Also, you may wish to review pp. 58-60.
      There is more discussion in the "pitfalls" section
      on pp. 120-123.
       
      There are four classes of loads:
      a. mechanical line loads and/or imposed displacement
         components, applied at centroids of discrete rings;
      b. thermal line loads at discrete rings;
      c. pressure and tractions distributed over the surface; 
      d. temperature distribution through thickness and over
         surface.
  
      In connection with mechanical line loads and/or imposed
      displacement components, the word "load" is used to mean
      either an imposed load or an imposed displacement.

194.1 LINAB= indicator (0, 1, 2 or 3) for load set A and B
194.2  
      0 means no line loads   (mechanical nor thermal loads
                               applied at rings)

      1 means only line load set A is present
      2 means only line load set B is present
      3 means both line load set A and line load set B are present

      Load set A is considered to be multiplied by the eigenvalue,
      whereas load set B is not. Load set B is a fixed preload.

196.0  
      Next, provide input for line loads in load set A.
      (loads that are to be multiplied by the eigenvalue)...
   
198.0  
      Next, provide input for line loads in load set B.
      (loads that are fixed--not to be multiplied by the eigenvalue)...
    
201.1 LINTYP= indicator (0, 1, 2 or 3) for type of line loads
201.2  
      0 means none
      1 means mechanical line loads and/or imposed displacements;
      2 means thermal line loads only;
      3 means both mechanical and thermal line loads.

      Note that if LINTYP is greater than 0 there must be
      discrete rings on which to "hang" the line loads and/or
      imposed displacement components.
      Line loads are assumed to act at the centroids of discrete
      rings.  They are positive as shown on page 74, bottom.  
      Imposed displacement components also "act" at ring centroids.
      They are positive as shown on page 51, bottom (USTAR,WSTAR,CHI).

      In the following input for line loads or imposed displacements...
       V(K) can mean axial load or imposed axial displacement;
            [note: positive V (load) is in opposite direction from
                   positive V (imposed axial displacement USTAR)]
       S(K) can mean circ. load or imposed circ. displacement;
      HF(K) can mean radial load or imposed radial displacement;
      FM(K) can mean meridional moment or imposed rotation CHI (p.51).
202.0  
      Data for mechanical line loads (disp.) should now be provided...
  
203.1 NTYPEL=index (use 4) for input of nonsymmetric line loads
203.2  
      NTYPEL = 4 means that line load amplitudes at various
      circumferential stations are to be provided by you. BOSOR4
      will then calculate the Fourier harmonics automatically.
      Please read p. 79 carefully before proceeding. An example
      is given on p. 108 and 109.

      NOTE...Line loads in each segment must be expressible as
      a product f(I)*g(theta), where I represents the Ith discrete
      ring.  g(theta) can differ from segment to segment, but must
      involve the same circumferential wave numbers, n = NSTART to
      NFIN in increments or decrements of INCR, for all segments.
      The Fourier series for axial load V, radial load H, and
      meridional moment M must be identical in a given segment.
      The Fourier series for the shear load S may be different.
      The total line load in BOSOR4 is a product of two factors:
      (1) f(I), representing V(i) or S(i) or H(i) or M(i), and
      (2) g(theta), a Fourier series.  Both factors are defined below.

204.1 NLOAD(1)=indicator for axial load or disp.(0=none,1=some)
205.1 NLOAD(2)=indicator for shear load or disp.(0=none,1=some)
206.1 NLOAD(3)=indicator for radial load or disp.(0 or 1)
207.1 NLOAD(4)=indicator for line moment or rotation (0 or 1)
208.1 V(i)=fixed or initial axial load or displacement, V
208.2  
      See figure at bottom of p. 74 for sign convention if V 
      signifies imposed axial load;  see Fig. at bottom of p. 51 if
      V signifies imposed axial displacement USTAR.
      Remember that line loads "go with" discrete rings in
      this segment. (e.g. V(2) is applied to the centroid of
      discrete ring no. 2 in this segment.)

      For linear nonsymmetric stress analysis the total axial line
      load or imposed axial displacement component USTAR (p. 51)

      Note that PLIN1(1) is associated with NSTART; PLIN1(2) is
      associated with NSTART + INCR; PLIN1(3) is associated with
      NSTART + 2*INCR; ... and PLIN1(NHARM) is associated with NFIN.
      See the discussion on p. 79.  Note,
      however, that the maximum number of harmonics NHARM is now
      greater than 20 (See "help" under NSTART).

      The total line load in BOSOR4 (for an axial load, for

231.1 NTYPEL=index (use 4) for input of nonsymmetric thermal loads
231.2  
      NTYPEL = 4 means that line load amplitudes at various
      circumferential stations are to be provided by you. BOSOR4
      will then calculate the Fourier harmonics automatically.
      Please read p. 81 carefully before proceeding.

      NOTE...Line loads in each segment must be expressible as
      a product f(I)*g(theta), where I represents the Ith discrete
      ring.  g(theta) can differ from segment to segment, but must
      involve the same circumferential wave numbers, n = NSTART to
      NFIN in increments or decrements of INCR, for all segments.
      The Fourier series for TNR, TMX, and TMY must be identical in
      a given segment.  The total thermal line load in BOSOR4 is the
      product of two factors:
      (1) f(I), represening TNR(i) or TMX(i) or TMY(i), and
      (2) g(theta), a Fourier series.  Both factors are defined below.

235.1 TNR(i)  = thermal hoop load, TNR
235.2  
       TNR(i) is obtained from the formulas in Table A2, p.74
       for load class #2.  The "T" in those formulas is a
       temperature rise distribution.  The actual temperature
       in the ring is the distribution T times the multiplier,
       TEMP or DTEMP, or times the circumferential harmonic,
       TLIN, depending on the type of analysis.  See Tables A3
       and A4 for details. Also, see p. 81.

                                  +TLIN(NHARM)*cos(NFIN*theta) ]

240.1 IDISAB= indicator (0, 1, 2 or 3) for load set A and B
240.2  
      0 means no distributed loads  (no pressure or thermal loading)
      1 means only distributed load set A is present
      2 means only distributed load set B is present
      3 means both distributed load set A and distributed load set B

      NLTYPE= 1 means pressure and/or surface traction, but
                no temperature distribution on this segment.

255.2  
      NTYPEL = 4 means that line load amplitudes at various
      circumferential stations are to be provided by you. BOSOR4
      will then calculate the Fourier harmonics automatically.
      Please read p. 85 carefully before proceeding.

      NOTE...The pressure and surface tractions in each segment
      must be expressible as a product f(s)*g(theta).  g(theta)
      can differ from segment to segment, but must involve the
      same circumferential wave numbers, n = NSTART to NFIN in
      increments or decrements of INCR, for all segments.  The
      Fourier series for normal pressure and meridional traction
      must be identical; that for the circumferential traction
      may be different.  The total distributed load in BOSOR4
      is a product of two factors:
      (1) f(I), representing PT(i) or PC(i) or PN(i), and
      (2) g(theta), a Fourier series.  Both factors are defined below.

256.1 NLOAD(1)=indicator for meridional traction (0=none, 1=some)

259.2  
      Sign convention is shown in the fig. on p. 74. Also, see
      Table A4 and p. 85.  The total traction is PT(i)*g(theta),
      where g(theta) is a Fourier series defined below.  In the

      where z is measured from the reference surface positive to
      the right of increasing meridional arc length, s.  In Tables
      A3 and A4 (pp. 75-76) the function T(s,z) is called "FUNCT".
      The actual temperature magnitude is given by T(s,z)*TEMP
      or T(s,z)*DTEMP for INDIC = -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, and for
      each circumferential harmonic by T(s,z)*TDIST for INDIC =

325.2  
      g(THETA) represents the circumferential variation of
      the load.
      NOPT = 1 means that g(THETA) is neither odd nor even
      about THETA = 0, and that therefore, both YPLUS(J) and

      YMINUS are the values of g(THETA) at the circumferential
      callout points.
       
      NOPT = 2 means that g(THETA) is either odd or even about
      THETA = 0, and that therefore, only YPLUS(J),J=1,NTHETA

      listed on p. 77, bottom.

326.1 NODD  = control integer for oddness, evenness, of g(THETA)
326.2  
      NODD = 1 means g(THETA) even for -THETAM.LE.THETA.LE.+THETAM
      NODD = 2 means g(THETA) odd
      NODD = 3 means g(THETA) is general (neither even nor odd)

327.1 THETA = circumferential coordinate, in degrees, THETA
327.2  
      The first value must be 0. and the last must be THETAM.
      All values must be positive and less than or equal to 180.
      The values need not be evenly spaced in THETA.

328.1 YPLUS = value of g(THETA) at THETA
328.2  
      Note that the total load is a product f(I) or f(s) times
      g(THETA), where f has already been supplied by you. It is
      usually a good idea to normalize g(THETA) so that its
      maximum value is unity.  Then the sign and the magnitude
      of the load can be associated with the factor, f(I) or f(s).

329.1 YMINUS= value of g(-THETA) at THETA
329.2  

      See the explanation under "HELP" for YPLUS.

341.2  
      NWALL = 1 means general C(i,j)  (see p.90)
      NWALL = 2 means monocoque isotropic
      NWALL = 4 means layered, composite layup, constant thickness
      NWALL = 5 means layered orthotropic, variable thickness
      NWALL = 6 means corrugated (corrugations run axially)
      NWALL = 7 means semi-sandwich axially corrugated, that is
                a smooth sheet is fastened to a corrugated sheet
      NWALL = 8 means layered orthotropic with temperature-
                dependent material properties, variable thickness
      NWALL = 9 means layered, composite layup with some layers
                with thickness that varies along the meridian.

      Smeared stiffeners may be added to any of these types.
      The smeared stiffeners may be either or both rings and
      stringers.

350.0
      Input for arbitrary C(i,j) follows (see pp.90-91)...

351.1 SMPA  = shell wall mass/area

364.1 C36
365.1 NRS  = control (0 or 1) for addition of smeared stiffeners
365.2  
      NRS  = 0 means no smeared stiffeners to be added to the wall;
      NRS  = 1 means yes, add smeared stiffeners to the wall.

370.0 
      Input for monocoque, isotropic wall construction...

371.1 E     = Young's modulus for skin
372.1 U     = Poisson's ratio for skin
373.1 SM =mass density of skin (e.g. alum.=.00025 lb-sec**2/in**4)
374.1 ALPHA = coefficient of thermal expansion
375.1 NRS  = control (0 or 1) for addition of smeared stiffeners
375.2  
      NRS  = 0 means no smeared stiffeners;
      NRS  = 1 means yes, add smeared stiffeners.

376.1 NSUR   = control for thickness input (0 or 1 or -1)
376.2  
      NSUR   = 0 means reference surface is middle surface
                (We will not need to provide thickness, since
                 we have already provided ZVAL, the distance
                 from the leftmost surface to the ref. surf.)

      NSUR   = 1 means the reference surface is the outer or
                rather the rightmost surface. Again, we do
                not need to provide input for the thickness,
                since ZVAL is the same as the thickness in
                this case.

      NSUR   =-1 means that the reference surface is arbitrarily
                located with respect to the leftmost surface (It
                might be the leftmost surface itself).  Therefore,
                you will have to provide additional input data
                to establish the wall thickness.

377.1 NTYPET= index (1 or 3) for type of input for thickness
377.2  
      NTYPET = 1 means variable thickness.  You will have to
                 provide callouts along the meridian and values
                 for the thickness at these callouts;

      NTYPET = 3 means constant thickness. You will have to
                 provide a value for this constant thickness.

378.1 NTVALU= number of callouts along segment for thickness
378.2  
      Range of NTVALU is 2 to 20.
      The discussion associated with the input for the
      reference surface location applies here also.

379.1 NTYPE = control for meaning of thickness callout (2=z, 3=r)
379.2  
      See pp. 69 for further discussion and examples.
      NTYPE = 2 means callouts for meridional variation of
                thickness will be axial coordinates;

      NTYPE = 3 means callouts will be radial coordinates.

380.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith thickness callout, z
380.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

381.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith thickness callout, r
381.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

382.1 TVAL(i) = thickness at Ith callout, TVAL
382.2  
      Thickness varies linearly between callouts.

383.1 TVAL = thickness (constant in this segment)
384.0 
      Input for laminated composite wall...

385.1 number of layers in the wall
385.2  
      NOTE: the maximum number of layers total is 90.

386.1 layer index (1,2,...), for layer no.
386.2  
      A layer index implies the following "bundle" of properties:

         1. thickness of the layer
         2. winding angle of the layer (degrees between the
            normal to the screen and the direction in which the
            modulus E1 (fiber direction) is measured)
         3. material type of the layer

      The three properties just listed are identical in two different
      layers if both of these layers have the same layer index.

387.1 Is this a new layer type?
388.0 
      thickness, winding angle, material for layer index

389.1 thickness for layer index no.
390.1 winding angle (deg.) for layer index no.
390.2 
      The definition of winding angle is: the angle in degrees
      measured from the meridional direction to the direction in
      which the fiber modulus E1 is measured. The winding angle
      must be constant along the meridional coordinate.

391.1 material index (1,2,...) for layer index no.
392.0  
      You will next be asked to provide material properties corres-
      ponding to the material types that you have already indicated.

393.2 
      If any of the materials in previous segments with composite
      layups (NWALL=4) was the same as the present material, answer
      N. If this is a new material, answer Y.

394.0 
      In the following:

        E1 = modulus in the fiber direction
        E2 = modulus transverse to fibers in the plane of the layer
         G = in-plane shear modulus
        NU = Poisson's ratio: NU = NU12 = NU21 * E2/E1
             NOTE: the NU you provide is the smallest of the two if
                   E1 > E2.  This is a bit unusual, so BEWARE!

395.1 modulus in the fiber direction, E1
396.1 modulus transverse to fibers,   E2
397.1 in-plane shear modulus,          G
398.1 small Poisson's ratio,          NU
399.1 thermal expansion along fibers, A1
400.1 transverse thermal expansion,   A2
401.1 residual stress temperature (positive),TEMPTUR
401.2 
      Degrees must be consistent with thermal expansion coefficients,
      A1 and A2 given previously.  What is wanted here is the
      difference between the setting temperature and room temperature,
      that is, the delta temperature that governs the magnitude of
      residual stresses and deformations in the panel due to curing.
      TEMPTUR should be zero or positive.

402.1 mass density (e.g. lb-sec**2/in. Aluminum=.00025), DENS
402.2 
      What is wanted is mass density m, not weight density mg.

403.0 
      Next, you will be asked to provide five maximum allowable
      stresses:
         maximum tensile stress along fibers,         sig1(tension)
         maximum compressive stress along fibers,     sig1(comp.)
         maximum tensile stress normal to fibers,     sig2(tension)
         maximum compressive stress normal to fibers, sig2(comp.)
         maximum in-plane shear stress,               sig12
      These maximum allowables correspond to a single lamina of
      composite material (tape or cloth). The thickness of a single
      lamina is often something like 0.005 inches.

404.1 maximum tensile stress along fibers, matl

422.2  
      Range of NTIN is 2 to 20
423.1 NTYPE = control for meaning of thickness callout (2=z, 3=r)
423.2  
      See pp. 69 for further discussion and examples.
      NTYPE = 2 means callouts for meridional variation of
                thickness will be axial coordinates;

      NTYPE = 3 means callouts will be radial coordinates.

424.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith thickness callout, z
424.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

425.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith thickness callout, r
425.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with

      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-

426.0 
      You will next be asked to provide input for the thicknesses
      of each layer at each of the callout points. Please provide

      first, then provide thicknesses at all callouts for layer 2,

427.1 Any more layers with varying thickness in this segment?
427.2 
      As many as ten of the layers may have thickness that
      varies along the segment.  Note that you can select
      layers the thickness of which varies. You do not have
      to provide variable-thickness input data for layers whose
      thickness is constant in this segment.

428.0 
      Next, you will be asked to provide data pertaining to the
      thickness of one or more layers that varies along the
      meridian. Please provide the input data in the proper order:

      You must provide data for the lowest-numbered layer the
      thickness of which varies first. (Layer 1 is the leftmost
      layer of the laminate as you face in the direction of
      increasing meridional coordinate, s).

      Note that only selected layers need have variable thickness input.
      In most cases most of the layers in this laminate will be of
      constant thickness.

      For a given layer, you must provide the callout locations on
      the meridian in the proper order: from the beginning of the
      segment to the end, and you must be sure to include the points
      at the beginning and at the end of the segment. Then you must
      provide the thicknesses in the same order as the callouts.
      BOSOR4 linearly interpolates between callouts. 

429.1 Layer number of layer with varying thickness
429.2 
      Layer numbering is from the leftmost layer as you face in the
      direction of increasing meridional coordinate, s. The
      leftmost layer is layer number 1. Note that you can select
      layers whose thickness varies. You do not need to provide
      variable-thickness input data for all the layers in the
      laminate, only those for which the thickness really varies.

430.0 
      Input for layered orthotropic with temperature-dependent

      Properties of the ith layer (i=1 is the leftmost layer) are
      to be given by you for a number, NPOINT(i), of values of the
      temperature. (Max. is 20 values per layer). The program
      obtains properties for any temperature by linear interpolation
      between the values that you will give. First, you will be
      asked to give the temperatures; then you will be asked to
      give the properties (G, EX, EY, UXY, ALPHA1, ALPHA2) at those
      temperatures.  Properties are to be provided vs. temperature 
      in the inner loop.  The outer loop is over the number of
      layers, starting with the leftmost layer as layer # 1.

      Note that this branch can be used to study shells in which
      the properties may vary over the surface, even though there
      is no actual temperature dependence. If you are resorting to
      this "trick", make sure to set the coefficients of thermal
      expansion equal to zero.

646.1 INOUT  = 0 for inside; 1 for outside corrugations
648.1 PHI = knockdown factor for torsional rigidity, PHI
648.2  
      The true torsional rigidity of the semi-sandwich
      axially corrugated wall is generally considerably less
      than what you would compute for a stiffener with a closed
      cross section with enclosed area A and corrugated and
      smooth skins of thicknesses just given by you. The reduction
      is due to local deformation of the cross section, which
      depends on the fabrication method (riveting vs. bonding)
      and on the axial wavelength of the deformation. Results of
      a parameter study appear in Fig. 13 on page 1290 of AIAA
      Journal, V. 11, Sept. 1973. (PHI is called k3 in that Fig.)
      Typical values for PHI are 0.3 for riveted construction,
      0.6 for continuously bonded construction.

650.1 BAXIAL=Knockdown factor for axial bending stiffness
650.2   
      Just as with the torsional rigidity, the axial bending
      stiffness [C(4,4) term] depends on the axial wavelength
      of the deformation pattern and on the fabrication method
      (riveting vs. bonding). Results of a parameter study appear
      in Fig. 12 on page 1290 of AIAA Journal, V. 11, Sept. 1973.
      (BAXIAL is called k1 in that Fig.) Typical values for
      BAXIAL are 0.9 for riveted and 0.95 for bonded construction.

652.1 BHOOP=Knockup factor for circum. bending stiffness
652.2  
      The hoop (circumferential) bending stiffness [C(5,5 term]
      is somewhat greater than nominal because the combination
      of smooth skin of thickness TS plus corrugated skin thickness
      CT over the riveted or bonded region of width CD has greater
      circumferential bending stiffness than the sum of the bending
      stiffnesses of each of these two layers. Try BHOOP = 1.17 for
      riveted construction; BHOOP = 1.30 for continuously bonded.

      See pp. 69 for further discussion and examples.

      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

661.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith thickness callout, r
661.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
