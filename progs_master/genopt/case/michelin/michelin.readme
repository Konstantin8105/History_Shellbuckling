********************************************
IMPORTANT NOTE (May 8,2014):
This file, michelin.readme, was developed
early in March, 2014. Several modifications
were made after that, not only to the "michelin"
software, behavior.michelin and bosdec.michelin,
but also to BIGBOSOR4. Therefore, the optimized
designs will now be somewhat different from
those listed here. Also, the recommended series
of runs may be somewhat different now from what it
was early in March.

===========================================================

OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE "michelin" GENERIC CASE 

The generic case called "michelin" involves
externally pressurixed complexly corrugated shells
in which the corrugations run in the circumferential
direction. The external pressure is lateral pressure
only, not hydrostatic pressure; there is no axial
loading component of magnitude pr/2. The name for the
generic case, michelin, was chosen because the complexly
corrugated shell could potentially resemble the
well-known Michelin Tire Man, a familiar icon of the
Michelin Tire Company.

The generic case called "michelin" is analogous to
that for the generic case called "span9": in "michelin"
the corrugations run in the circumferential direction
("michelin" = shells of revolution), whereas in "span9"
the corrugations run in the axial direction (span9 =
prismatic panels).

The software, behavior.michelin, struct.michelin and
bosdec.michelin, for the generic case called "michelin" is
analogous to that for the generic case called "span9", and
the two input files for the GENOPT processor GENTEXT,
michelin.INP for the generic case "michelin" and span9.INP
for the generic case "span9", are identical. Therefore,
the prompting files, michelin.PRO and span9.PRO, are
identical.

Since the GENTEXT input files, michelin.INP and span9.INP,
are identical, some of the data names used in the generic
case called "span9" are inappropriate for the generic case
called "michelin". In particular, the first three data
names and their definitions listed in the input file,
*.BEG, for the BEGIN prcessor of GENOPT for a specific
"michelin" case called "mich8" (mich8.BEG) are as follows:

100.0  $ total width of the corrugated plate: WIDTH
  4.0  $ axial length of the corrugated plate: LENGTH
  3.0  $ fraction of LENGTH for local buckling model: FACLEN

In "span9" these three data names and definitions are
appropriate (although the data value, 4.0 for LENGTH,
is dubious and the data value, 3.0 for FACLEN, is inappropriate.
In "michelin" the first datum, 100.0, is the actually the axial
length of the shell of revolution, the second datum, 4.0, is
the value of the BIGBOSOR4 analysis type index, INDIC,
and the third datum, 3.0, is the number, MMM, of repeating
modules used in the BIGBOSOR4 model for general instability.

 13            -2                      -2
----------------------------------------------------

The parameter called "LENGTH" in the various
input and output files is a "leftover" from
the generic case "span9", in which the complex corrugations
run in the axial direction rather than circumferenially,
which is so for the generic case called "michelin".
In the "michelin" application the parameter called
"LENGTH" becomes a strategy parameter often
called "strategy" or "ISTRAT" in the following text.

In the work described here only two values of LENGTH
are used: LENGTH = 1 for linear theory (BIGBOSOR4
analysis type indicator, INDIC = 4) and LENGTH = 13 
for nonlinear theory (BIGBOSOR4 analysis type indicator,
INDIC = -2).

INDIC = 4 correponds to the analysis
branch in BIGBOSOR4 in which a linear static response
for, in general, a non-axisymmetrically loaded shell
of revolution is computed by Fourier superposition
of deformations with n = 0, 1, 2,. .., NMAX circumferential
waves. [In the present work only axisymmetric (n=0)
deformations are considered for the pre-buckled
state of the circumferentially corrugated shell.]
Buckling load factors are computed corresponding to the
state of the pre-buckled shell along a particular
user-selected meridian, presumably the meridian
that is associated with the most destabilizing pre-buckling
("worst") stress resultants. (Here we select the meridian
at circumferential coordinate, THETAS = 0.0 degrees.) 
Whatever state exists along the user-selected
meridian is assumed to be axisymmetric (a conservative
approximation, since, for the purpose of the buckling
phase of the computations, the "worst" stress resultants
are assumed to exist at all circumferential coordinates).

INDIC = -2 corresponds to one of the analysis branches
in BIGBOSOR4 in which buckling is determined from
nonlinear geometric theory for an axisymmetrically
loaded, elastic, shell of revolution. A conservative
approach to the buckling problem is taken. For a
user-selected number of circumferential waves, the
stability determinant is computed for a sequence
of increasing loads. When it has been detected
that one or more roots (changes in sign of the
stability determinant) have been passed, the analysis
type indicator, INDIC, is automatically changed
from INDIC = -2 to INDIC = -1, and the buckling
analysis proceeds as if INDIC had always been -1.
In the INDIC = -1 analysis branch BIGBOSOR4 searches
for a minimum buckling load factor in the
neighborhood of circumferential waves surrounding
the initially user-selected number of circumferential
waves. At the critical circumferential wavenumber
nonlinear iterations proceed until a certain
pre-specified degree of convergence has been attained.

In SUBROUTINE BOSDEC2 of the library called:
 /home/progs/bosdec/sources/bosdec.michelin
there exists the new statement:

 MMM = FACLEN + 0.0001 

in which MMM is the number of repeating sections of
length = WIDTH that occur in the shell of revolution
e.g. "mich8") that is being analyzed by BIGBOSOR4 for
the prediction of general instability. 

The BIGBOSOR4 model used for local buckling depends ot the
value of INDIC. For INDIC = 4 (linear buckling) SUBROUTINE
BOSDEC2 is called with MMM = 1. For INDIC < 4 (nonlinear
buckling with the use of various strategies) SUBROUTINE
BOSDEC is called. There is no parameter, MMM, used in BOSDEC.
SUBROUTINE BOSDEC produces an input file for BIGBOSOR4 for a
"half-model", that is a model that includes the shell segments
from the bottom of the shell of revolution to its first plane
of symmetry, an axial distance equal to length = WIDTH/2.
(For the specific case, mich8, WIDTH/2 is approximately
equal to 50 inches.

In the input file, mich8.BEG, there exists the following line:

   -20.0     $ total axial load (e.g. lb): TOTLOD(  1)

In "michelin" this input datum is the lateral pressure
(e.g. psi, negative for external pressure), not the total
axial load, as is so for the old "span9" generic case.

There are now no
behavioral constraints corresponding to "classical" buckling
of each corrugation, that is, CYLBUK(i), i=1,2,...NSEGS, are
not computed. As with BUKASY, CYLBUK(i), i=1,2,...NSEGS, are
set equal to very high values so that they do not affect
the evolution of the design during optimization cycles.

The behavioral constraint for maximum effective stress is
computed from a "half-length" BIGBOSOR4 model (as if MMM = 0.5),
that is, an axial length of the shell of revolution from
the bottom to its first symmetry plane, which occurs at
axial station, WIDTH/2. SUBROUTINE BOSDEC is used for
the computation of maximum effective stress.

HOW TO RUN michelin/mich8

-----------------------------------------------------------
Establishing for the first time the software for the
generic case called "michelin":

cd /home/progs/genoptcase     (go to directory for executing GENOPT)
gentext (run the program that generates the prompt file: michelin.PRO)
(Starting from struct.new and behavior.new, which are skeletal
libraries created automatically by GENOPT during the GENTEXT process,
you must "flesh out" struct.new and behavior.new so that these
subroutines will now perform the analyseis you want. Also, you must
create the libraries, bosdec.src and bosdec2.src, that generate input
files for BIGBOSOR4 and STAGS. Save your "fleshed out" versions of
behavior.new and struct.new and also save the subroutines, bosdec.src
and bosdec2.src, which are  entirely created by you. You spent a lot
of time creating these four files. Archive them with appropriate names,
such as struct.michelin, behavior.michelin, bosdec.michelin (It is
logical to include SUBROUTINE BOSDEC2 in bosdec.src, which is now a
library of subroutines and not just one subroutine called BOSDEC.)

In this particular generic case "michelin" I created the software,
behavior.michelin and bosdec.michelin by analogy with the
generic case called "span9". struct.michelin is identical to
struct.span9. The overall structure of behavior.michelin is
the same as the overall structure of behavior.span9, but
there are many details that are different. For example,
local bucking can now be determined from a BOSDEC2 model in
which MMM = 1 or local buckling can be determined from a
BOSDEC "half" model (in effect MMM=0.5). General buckling is now determined from
a BOSDEC2 model in which MMM may have any value greater than 1. 
Similarly, the overall
structure of bosdec.michelin is the same as that in
the file, bosdec.span9.smoothing. NOTE: Only the "smoothing"
option is used in the generic case "michelin", and there is
no option that is based on HUGEBOSOR4.)

genprograms    (generate executable elements for michelin)
(Doubtless there will be errors. Correct them and rerun
genprograms. You will probably need to do this many times
in order to eliminate all the errors. Each time you do this
"loop" make sure to re-save the latest versions of struct.new,
behavior.new and bosdec.src as the archived files:
struct.michelin, behavior.michelin, bosdec.michelin)

(If you wish to run GENTEXT and GENPROGRAMS for some generic
case, michelin, that you have previously perfected, then do
the following instead of what is written in the previous
several paragraphs:)
cd /home/progs/genoptcase     (go to directory for executing GENOPT)
cp /home/progs/genopt/case/michelin/michelin.tar.gz/.
gunzip michelin.tar.gz    (uncompress michelin.tar.gz)
tar xvf michelin.tar      (get the files within michelin.tar)
(one of these files is called michelin.INP: input for GENTEXT)
gentext     (use michelin.INP as the input file)
cp struct.michelin struct.new
cp behavior.michelin behavior.new
cp bosdec.michelin /home/progs/bosdec/sources/bosdec.src
genprograms      (generates the generic "michelin" software)

(the command "superduperopt" generates files, mich8.OPP.1, mich8.OPP.2,
mich8.OPP.3, ... Inspect each one of these *.OPP.* files. Also,
"superduperopt" generates files, mich8.PL2.1, mich8.PL2.2, mich8.PL2.3,
... You can get plots of the objective (WEIGHT) versus design iteration
corresponding to each of the mich8.OPP.i, i = 1, 2, 3,..., by doing
the following:
cp mich8.PL2.1 mich8.PL2
chooseplot (choose what to plot. The input data file is mich8.CPL, which
is as follows:
  N     $ Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?
  N     $ Any design variables to be plotted v. iterations (Y or N)?
  N     $ Any design margins to be plotted v. iterations (Y or N)?
  Y     $ Do you want to get more plots before your next "SUPEROPT"?
NOTE: It is very important that the 4th and last entry be "Y"! If you
      answer "N" to this last prompt, you will not be able to get
      plots corresponding to mich8.OPP.2, mich8.OPP.3, etc.

diplot  (generate the file, mich8.5.ps, which is a postscript file that
         is used to produce a plot on your screen via the next "gv" command.)

gv mich8.5.ps (get a plot of objective versus design iteration 
               corresponding to mich8.OPP.1. You might want to
               save this file because it will be over-written
               by the following commands.)

(archive the final "FEASIBLE" or "ALMOST FEASIBLE" optimum design:)
change     (produces mich8.CHG, which, due to your interactive input,
            contains the optimized values of all the decision variables.
            You can use mich8.CHG in the future to restore this optimized

NOTE: In order to get plots of the extreme fiber effective stress
along the meridian of the shell, you have to edit the mich8.ALL
file by changing NLAST from 0 to 1 . The relevant line in the mich8.ALL
file is just after the line containing the string, "GLOBAL".
Then you type the commands, bigbosorall followed by bosorplot.
Choose the "X" option rather than the "P" option, then choose
Item No. 6: mich8u..RESULTS_MERIDIAN_1 . You will get 4 successive
"windows" with plots of (1) meridional stress, (2) circumferential
stress, (3) in-plane shear stress, and (4) von Mises effective
stress. You want (4). (You get each successive "window" by
hitting the "close" icon in the upper right-hand corner of each
"window" except the 4th (effective stress). That window you want
to same. Hit "HRDCPY" on the upper left-hand side
of the window; type an appropriate file name, such as "mich8.ps",
then click on "Ok". The file "mich8.ps" will exist in the working
directory for executions of BIGBOSOR4 (e.g. /home/progs/work4).
Archive that file with the command:
cp mich8.ps /home/progs/genoptcase/mich8.ploteffstress.linear.ps
or some such archive file name.

Getting design sensitivity of the optimized mich8 for one of the
decision variables:

cd /home/progs/genoptcase    (go to directory for executing GENOPT)

(First run MAINSETUP for the optimized design with
NPRINT = 2 and ITYPE = 1:
mainsetup         (use mich8.OPT with NPRINT=2; ITYPE=1)
optimize          (the run terminates abnormally on purpose.
                   Inspect the mich8.OPM file. Search for the
                   string, "G R A D". Expand the window width-
                   wise to obtain an easily readable output.
                   Look at the values of the maximum gradient,
                   and see which decision variable that maximum
                   gradient corresponds to. Use that decision
                   variable in your design sensitivity analysis,
                   that is, the analysis for which ITYPE = 3
                   in the input file for MAINSETUP: mich8.OPT.)

(Next, run MAINSETUP with with input such as that listed below.)

mainsetup (set up to run design sensitivity: ITYPE=3; mich8.OPT)
(sample input data for mainsetup for design sensitivity case:)

      N         $ Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?
         0      $ Choose an analysis you DON'T want (1, 2,..), IBEHAV
         0      $ NPRINT= output index (0=GOOD, 1=ok, 2=debug, 3=too much)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended series of optimizations:

1. First optimize a uniform corrugation (specific case called "mich8u")
   This requires a number of preliminary optimization runs (ITYPE=1)
   in order to get the first and last shell segment to have the proper
   geometry. This series of runs is done in a loop. In each pass through
   this loop the following is performed:

   cleanspec mich8u (clean up files for the specific case: mich8u)
   begin (initial starting design; use mich8u.BEG as input)
   decide (choose decision variables, bounds, etc.; YPLATE(i) are
           fixed, that is, YPLATE(i) are NOT decision variables,
           and PHISEG(i), i = 2, 3,...8, are linked to PHISEG(1).)
   mainsetup (set up for optimization: ITYPE = 1; ITER = 5; IMOVE = 5)
   superopt  (use 8 executions of OPTIMIZE per execution of AUTOCHANGE)
   (You may want to terminate the SUPEROPT execution after about 10
    minutes in order to save time. Remember, you are in an interation
    loop. Inspect the mich8u.OPP file, especially the "BEST FEASIBLE"
    design. Next, save the "BEST FEASIBLE" design via CHANGE.)
   change  (archive the optimized design with the use of CHANGE)
   mainsetup (provide input to perform the analysis of the "fixed"
              design that was optimized via SUPEROPT: ITYPE = 2)
   optimize (perform the "fixed design" analysis; Inspect the
             mich8u.OPM file from the "fixed design" analysis.
             Especially inspect THICK(i) and PHISEG(i), i=1,2,3..8)
   cd /home/progs/work4 (working space for execution of BIGBOSOR4)
   bigbosor4log (initialize BIGBOSOR4)
   cp /home/progs/genoptcase/mich8u.BEHX5 mich8u.ALL (BOSOR input)
   bigbosorall    (execute BIGBOSOR4)
   cleanup        (get properly annotated mich8.ALL file)

   (For each shell segment in the *.ALL file there exists the
    following line:
    N  $ Do you want to print out r(s), r'(s), etc. for this segment?
    Change the "N" to "Y" because you need to see the values of
    the maximum radius (called "RAD") and minimum radius in segments
    that are not the end segment nor smoothing segments. The
    maximum "RAD" is to be used as a new value of YPLATE(1), and
    the minimum "RAD" is to be used as a new value of YPLATE(9).)

   bigbosorall (execute BIGBOSOR4 with the revised mich8u.ALL file)

   (Inspect the mich8u.OUT file. Find the maximum and minimum
    values of radius "RAD" in non-smoothing and in non-end
    segments. RAD(maximum) will become YPLATE(1) and
    RAD(minimum) will become YPLATE(9) when you revise the
    mich8u.BEG file in preparation for another trip through the
    iteration loop.)

   (insert the optimized thicknesses THICK(i) and angles PHISEG(i)
    into a revised mich8u.BEG file in preparation for the next
    trip through the loop. Insert RAD(maximum) in place of
    YPLATE(1) and RAD(minimum) in place of YPLATE(9).)

   cd /home/progs/genoptcase
   cleanspec mich8u (clean up files for the specific case: mich8u)

   (redo the loop by executing BEGIN with the revised input file,
    mich8u.BEG, followed by executions of decide, mainsetup, superopt,
    change, mainsetup, optimize, bigbosorall, cleanup, bigbosorall,
    with intermediate editings as listed above.)

   (In the present specific case, mich8u, three times through the
    loop were required in order to get reasonably well converged
    values of THICK(i) & PHISEG(i) and YPLATE(1) and YPLATE(9).
    Here are the values of YPLATE(1) and YPLATE(9) for the design
    before the loop was entered for the first time and each
    subsequent trip through the loop:
                  trip through the loop:      final values:
                   0,      1,    2,    3
    YPLATE(1): 38.57143, 36.69, 37.3, 37.1        37.1
    YPLATE(9): 31.42857, 33.35, 32.9, 33.0        33.0
    The first value corresponds to a configuration in which the
    half-angle, PHISEG(2) = PHISEG(3) = ... = PHISEG(7) = 90 degrees,
    and the half angles, PHISSEG(1)  = PHISEG(8) = 45 degrees.
    The final optimum design corresponds to a configuration in which
    PHISEG(2) = PHISEG(3) = ... = PHISEG(7) = 61.06 degrees,
    and the half angles, PHISSEG(1)  = PHISEG(8) = 30.53 degrees.
    The final optimized values of YPLATE(i), i = 1,2,3,...9, are:
    YPLATE(i) = 37.1, 35., 35., 35., 35., 35., 35., 35., 33.0
    The values of SUBWID(i), i = 1,2,3,...8, never change. They are:
    3.571429,
    7.142857, 7.142857, 7.142857, 7.142857, 7.142857, 7.142857,
    3.571429
    The sum of the 8 values of SUBWID(i) equals half the length
    (called "WIDTH" in this generic "michelin" application) of the shell.

   (We now have the optimized design of the uniformly corrugated shell.)

   NOTE: The mich8u.BEG file has the following for YPLATE(i), i=1,2,..9:
   36.55, 34.45, 34.45, 34.45, 34.45, 34.45, 34.45, 34.45, 34.45, 32.45
   These values are different from the "final" values of YPLATE(i)
   listed above as those for the optimized design of the uniformly
   corrugated shell:
    YPLATE(i) = 37.1, 35., 35., 35., 35., 35., 35., 35., 33.0
   Unfortunately, I do not recall what computer runs produced the
   quite different values, YPLATE(i) = 36.55, 34.45, 34.45,...32.45.
   Nonetheless, those are the values that I now regard as "final"
   for the specific case, mich8u.


3. Next, we want to optimize a new specific case called "mich8",
   in which YPLATE(I) are now included as decision variables,
   PHISEG((i), i = 1,2,3...8, are all decision variables.

   (See the list following the heading, "Refine the optimum design"
    for details.)

4. Step 3, optimization of the specific case called "mich8"
   comes up with new values of YPLATE(i), i=1,2,...9. It is
   important next to compare the value of YPLATE(1) (radius
   at the bottom of the BIGBOSOR4 model) with the value of
   YPLATE(1) used in the specific case called "mich8u" (Step 1).
   Usually, YPLATE(1) in the optimized "mich8" case will be
   somewhat less than YPLATE(1) in the "mich8u" case. Say that
   YPLATE(1) in the optimized "mich8" case is less than
   YPLATE(1) in the "mich8u" case. (In this study YPLATE(1)
   in the optimized "mich8" case is 36.55 inches and YPLATE(1)
   in the "mich8u" case is 37.1 inches. The difference,
   DYPLATE(1) = 0.55 inches. In order to make the comparison
   of WEIGHT fair, we must re-optimize "mich8u", first
   subtracting DYPLATE(1) from all the YPLATE(i), i=1,2,...9,
   in the mich8u.BEG file, and then reoptimizing mich8u from
   the beginning.) Subtracting DYPLATE(1) from all the
   YPLATE(i), i=1,2,...9, in the mich8u.BEG file moves the
   starting mich8u profile either toward or away from the
   axis of revolution, depending on whether DYPLATE(1) is
   negative or positive, respectively.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

How to get plots of more than one optimized profile in the
same plot frame:

cd /home/progs/genoptcase
(Get an optimized design in the usual way.)
cd /home/progs/work4  (go to working directory for executions
                       of BIGBOSOR4)
cp /home/progs/genoptcase/mich8.BEHX5 mich8.ALL (input data for
                                                 BIGBOSOR4)
bigbosorall    (execute BIGBOSOR4)
(One of the output files from BIGBOSOR4 is called mich8.PLT2.
 mich8.PLT2 is a plot file that is used by BIGBOSOR4.
 mich8.PLT2 is the wrong format to be used with Bill Bushnell's
 stand-alone version of plotps: /home/progs/bin/plotps.x86_64.
 Editing of mich8.PLT2 is needed. Here's how to edit mich8.PLT2:
 1. Delete the first approximately 20 lines that are not data.
 2. Search for the character R
 3. Delete all lines including and following $END PLOT
 4. The first column (nodal points) must be removed. Do this
    for each line using the "vi" command "5x". You have to do
    this many, many times (about 600 in the mich8 case).
 5. Add the following to the beginning of the data file:
    # Global directives, optimized mich8 
    =title(Optimized profiles, mich8u and mich8)
    =xlabel(Radius (inches))
    =ylabel(Axial coordinate (inches))
    # data set 1
    +legend(mich8)
    +markeroff
    #+linestyle(dashed)
 (The "#" sign means "comment line")
 You now have input data that are suitable for use with
 Bill Bushnell's stand-alone utility, plotps.
 Don't worry about the 7 columns of data that follow the
 first two columns (radius, axial coordinate). plotps will
 ignore those additional 7 columns.

 IMPORTANT NOTE: You did lots of work producing the file
 mich8.PLT2 in a form suitable for use with Bill Bushnell's
 stand-alone version of plotps. Therefore, be sure to
 save a copy of this file where it will not be accidentally
 deleted! For example, I typed the following command:
 cp mich8.PLT2 ../genoptcase/mich8.bigbosor4.plotprofile.plt2

 Next, type the commands:
 'rm' mich8.ps
 /home/progs/bin/plotps.x86_64 -ss < mich8.PLT2 > mich8.ps

 The "-ss" option means "samescale", which means that the
 axial and radial coordinates will be plotted to the same
 scale and the optimized profile will therefore be true.
 mich8.ps will contain a single trace: that corresponding
 to the optimized profile for the specific case, mich8.
 In order to see this plot on your screen, type the command:
 gv mich8.ps     ("gv" means "ghost view")

 So far, you only have the profile corresponding to the
 optimized specific case called "mich8". You have to repeat
 the above sequence of operations for the other case,
 mich8u (uniform corrugations)
 The two optimized profiles, mich8 and mich8u,
 look the same when plotted individually from BIGBOSOR4.
 The two traces must be plotted in the same frame in
 order to see the difference.

 After you have created suitable "PLT2" files for the
 case, mich8u, you must add this new "PLT2"
 data set to that for mich8. You do not repeat the initial
 directives, of course, but you must introduce the new
 data set with the following lines:
 # data set 2
 +legend(mich8u)
 +markeroff
 +linestyle(dashed)

Suppose you call the combined plot file, that is the file with
the two data sets, "combined.PLT2". Then, the commands:
 'rm' combined.ps
 /home/progs/bin/plotps.x86_64 -ss < combined.PLT2 > combined.ps
 will produce a handsome plot with the two optimized profiles
 superposed. Be sure to archive the file, combined.PLT2.
 I have archived the input and output plot files as follows:
 /home/progs/work6/mich8.mich8u.optimizedprofiles.input
 /home/progs/work6/mich8.mich8u.optimizedprofiles.ps
 Therefore, in order to get the two-trace plot (mich8 and mich8u)
 on my screen, I would type the lengthy command:
 /home/progs/bin/plotps.x86_64 -ss
  < /home/progs/work6/mich8.mich8u.optimizedprofiles.input
  > /home/progs/work6/mich8.mich8u.optimizedprofiles.ps

5. Get plots of the objective versus design iterations
corresponding to each of the 5 (or possibly fewer) executions
of SUPEROPT during the long SUPERDUPEROPT run. How to
do this is described above. The resulting plot files
are as follows:
 Mar  4 12:31 mich1.superopt1.852.linear.ps
 Mar  4 12:32 mich1.superopt2.852.linear.ps
 Mar  4 12:33 mich1.superopt3.852.linear.ps
 Mar  4 12:34 mich1.superopt4.852.linear.ps
 Mar  4 12:35 mich1.superopt5.852.linear.ps

6. Use the GENOPT processor CHANGE to archive the best FEASIBLE
design. The input file for CHANGE (mich1.CHG) is as follows:
   N       $ Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?
   Y       $ Do you want to change any values in Parameter Set No. 1?
      1    $ Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
 0.04418   $ New value of the parameter
   y       $ Want to change any other parameters in this set?
      2    $ Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
 4.673     $ New value of the parameter
   y       $ Want to change any other parameters in this set?
      3    $ Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
 34.1100   $ New value of the parameter
   y       $ Want to change any other parameters in this set?
      6    $ Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
 32.1200   $ New value of the parameter
   n       $ Want to change any other parameters in this set?
   N       $ Do you want to change values of any "fixed" parameters?
   N       $ Do you want to change any loads?
   N       $ Do you want to change values of allowables?
   N       $ Do you want to change any factors of safety?

7. Edit the mich1.OPT file (change NPRINT from 0 to 2 and
change ITYPE from 1 to 2) in order to get the mich1.OPM
file corresponding to the best FEASIBLE design. Then
execute MAINSETUP and OPTIMIZE for the "fixed" design option:
mainsetup    (the input file is mich1.OPT, as edited)
optimize     (produces the mich1.OPM file for the best design)

8. Archive the mich1.CHG and mich1.OPM files for the best
design obtained with use of the "852" strategy parameters.
In an execution of SUPEROPT (or SUPERDUPEROPT) "852" means
"8 OPTIMIZEs/AUTOCHANGE, IMOVE = 5 and IAUTOF = 2", in which
IMOVE and IAUTOF are described in the GENOPT permanent
prompting file, /home/progs/genopt/execute/URPROMPT.DAT.
The two archived files are as follows:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 bush bush  1095 Mar  4 12:52 mich1.linear.852.chg
-rw-rw-r-- 1 bush bush 12032 Mar  4 12:53 mich1.linear.852.opm

9. Clean up mich1 files and start over. The plan is to use
the file, mich1.CHG, with the GENOPT processor, CHANGE, to
re-establish the best FEASIBLE optimum design from linear
theory, then do some more optimizing using a more refined
strategy than the "852" strategy. In particular, the "1562"
strategy will be used, and instead of executing SUPEROPT
or SUPERDUPEROPT, perhaps a better optimum design will
be found by a few successive executions of OPTIMIZE.

begin      (use the same mich1.BEG file as before)

The following mich1.OPT file is used as input to MAINSETUP:)
   n       $ Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?
      0    $ Choose an analysis you DON'T want (1, 2,..), IBEHAV

      1    $ Choose type of analysis (1=opt., 2=fixed, 3=sensit.) ITYPE
     25    $ How many design iterations in this run (3 to 25)?
   n       $ Take "shortcuts" for perturbed designs (Y or N)?
      2    $ Choose 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 for IDESIGN
      6    $ Choose 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 for move limits, IMOVE
   n       $ Do you want default (RATIO=10) for initial move limit jump?
 100000    $ Provide a value for the "move limit jump" ratio, RATIO
   n         $ Do you want the default perturbation (dx/x = 0.05)?
 0.100E-01 $ Amount by which decision variables are perturbed, dx/x
   n       $ Do you want to have dx/x modified by GENOPT?
   n       $ Do you want to reset total iterations to zero (Type H)?
      2    $ Choose IAUTOF=1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 to change X(i)

 ================================================================

The best FEASIBLE design remains the same as before (See the
objective at Iteration No. 1 listed above.) Therefore,
we assume that the optimized design represented in the file, 
mich1.CHG, listed under Item No. 6 above, is really the best
"global" optimum design obtained with the use of linear theory.

Next, we obtain all sorts of plots corresponding to that best
"global" optimum design, including plots from various executions
of STAGS. (The use of STAGS is described above.)

************************** NOTE! ****************************
Results analogous to those referred to in the previous paragraph
were all derived from a slightly different optimized design, one
that evolved earlier with the use of the following input datum
in the mich1.OPT file:

   y         $ Do you want the default perturbation (dx/x = 0.05)?

The slightly better "global" optimum design evolves, and evolves
in a more reliable manner, if the single record above is replaced
by the following two records:

   n         $ Do you want the default perturbation (dx/x = 0.05)?
 0.100E-01 $ Amount by which decision variables are perturbed, dx/x

It appears that for the "michelin" configuration it is best to
use a much smaller design perturbation (0.01) rather than the
default value (0.05) for the computation of behavioral gradients,
especially local and general buckling gradients.

Because of laziness, I do not want to regenerate all the results
obtained earlier for a slightly different optimized FEASIBLE
design. Therefore, I now start with the design archived in the
following, somewhat different, earlier mich1.CHG file:
   N         $ Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?
   Y         $ Do you want to change any values in Parameter Set No. 1?
      1      $ Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
 0.44600E-01 $ New value of the parameter
   y         $ Want to change any other parameters in this set?
      2      $ Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
 4.673       $ New value of the parameter
   y         $ Want to change any other parameters in this set?
      3      $ Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
 33.6200     $ New value of the parameter
   y         $ Want to change any other parameters in this set?
      6      $ Number of parameter to change (1, 2, 3, . .)
 32.0900     $ New value of the parameter
   n         $ Want to change any other parameters in this set?
   N         $ Do you want to change values of any "fixed" parameters?
   N         $ Do you want to change any loads?
   N         $ Do you want to change values of allowables?
   N         $ Do you want to change any factors of safety?

This earlier archived optimized FEASIBLE design produces the
following data in a mich1.OPP file:

10. The effects of including nonlinear geometric behavior:

There are two phases of this presentation:

a. Predictions for the same design as that developed with the
use of linear theory, but with the use of nonlinear theory.

b. Re-optimization including nonlinear geometric effects.


11. We execute the GENOPT processor CLEANSPEC again, then
start over from BEGIN, but with different data in BEGIN

Note the following different records in the new mich1.BEG file:

a. LENGTH (a strategy index in the "michelin" application)=13.0.
           LENGTH=13.0 means that the BIGBOSOR4 index for type
           of analysis is -1 for both LOCAL and GENERAL buckling.)

b. The low ends of the M-ranges have been changed from 0 to 2
   for GENERAL buckling and from 0 to 125 for LOCAL buckling.
   The new "low ends of M-range" come from results for the
   critical numbers of circumferential waves in the buckling
   modes of the shell as optimized with the use of linear theory.

c. The factor of safety for LOCAL buckling has been reduced from
   2.0 to 1.6. This reduction is due to the fact that we will
   now account for nonlinear geometric effects.

Notice the following changes from the earlier version of mich1.DEC:

a. The minimum thicknese is that determined from optimization with
the use of linear theory.

b. The upper bound of thickness [variable no. (1)] has been greatly
reduced and is now not far above the lower bound. This is done in
order to prevent huge changes in the design during optimization
cycles, changes that might lead to failure of convergence of the
Newton method that is used to solve the nonlinear equations.

c. The lower and upper bounds of Variable no. 5 [YPLATE(2)] are
very, very close. This is done because the local and general
buckling behavioral constraints are extremely sensitive to changes
in YPLATE(2), as is demonstrated in Fig. xx. The bounds were
determined by a series of runs in the "design sensitivity" mode
(ITYPE=3 in the mich1.OPT file) in order to ascertain at what values
of YPLATE(2) failure of convergence of the NEWTON method occurred.


mainsetup (first do nonlinear analysis of the "fixed" design:

 Critical buckling load factor, BUKSYM=  1.0018E+00
 Critical number of circumferential waves, NWVCRT=    2

We see that the critical number of circumferential waves
for LOCAL BUCKLING has changed from NWVCRT = 125 for linear theory
to NWVCRT = 85 for nonlinear theory. The critical number of
circumferential waves for GENERAL BUCKLING remains the
same as before: NWVCRT = 2 .

We see that nothing has changed with regard to the

with re-optimization, this time with the use of nonlinear
theory rather than linear theory.

Edit the mich1.OPT file. The new mich1.OPT file follows:

mainsetup (establish the latest strategy for doing the
           optimization with the use of nonlinear theory.
           Notice that we use IMOVE = 6, which enforces
           very small "move" limits so that as the design
           evolves it changes very slowly from the previous
           optimum design. We do this because the buckling
           behavioral constraints are very, very sensitive
           especially to the value of YPLATE(2).)

superopt (use 15 OPTIMIZES/AUTOCHANGE)

250.

 first nonlinear, intentially "killed" execution of SUPEROPT.)

The mich1.5.ps file is archived as follows:
mich1.strategy13.fsloc1.6.mlowg2.mlowl90.partialsuperopt.objective.652.ps
The optimized design is essentially the same as in the
first nonlinear, intentially "killed" execution of SUPEROPT.

In the above text the strings, "1562", "1542" and "652" denote
various strategies used for the SUPEROPT executions:
"1562" means 15 OPTIMIZEs/AUTOCHANGE; IMOVE = 6; IAUTOF = 2
"1542" means 15 OPTIMIZEs/AUTOCHANGE; IMOVE = 4; IAUTOF = 2
"652"  means  6 OPTIMIZEs/AUTOCHANGE; IMOVE = 5; IAUTOF = 2

The strategy index, IMOVE, is described in the file
/home/progs/genopt/execute/URPROPMT.DAT as follows:

 730.0
 Next, choose a control for move limits to be used during
 optimization cycles. By "move limits" we are referring to
 the size of the boxes that appear in Fig. 2 of the paper,
 "GENOPT - a program that writes user-friendly optimization code",
 Int. J. Solids and Structures, Vol. 26, pp 1173- 1210, 1990.
 You are given five choices: IMOVE = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5:

 IMOVE = 1 means SMOVE = 0.10
 IMOVE = 2 means SMOVE = 0.50
 IMOVE = 3 means SMOVE = 0.01
 IMOVE = 4 means SMOVE = 0.02
 IMOVE = 5 means SMOVE = 0.05
 IMOVE = 6 means SMOVE = 0.005

 Small SMOVE (initial move limit) keeps the boxes small and
 leads to the requirement for many "OPTIMIZE" commands to
 obtain an optimum design; the "conservative" approach may
 be boring, but it may be the most reliable.  "Liberal" move
 limits allow bigger boxes, generally leading to the need for
 fewer "OPTIMIZEs".  However, the decision variables may
 jump around a lot and have difficulty converging to those
 corresponding to an optimum design.


The strategy index, IAUTF, is described in the file
/home/progs/genopt/execute/URPROPMT.DAT as follows:

749.1 Choose IAUTOF=1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 to change X(i)
749.2
 X(i) is the vector of decision variables. In AUTOCHANGE the
 decision variables, X(i), i = 1, 2, ... NDEC, are changed
 in one of the six following ways, that is, the index
 you must provide now (named "IAUTOF") can be one of the
 following: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6:

 If IAUTOF = 1 the formula used to change the vector X(i)
 is as follows:
    X(I) = Y(I)*(1. + DVARS(I))
 in which Y(I) is the original vector of decision variables,
 DVARS(I) is given by DVARS(I) = 2.0*DVAR(I) - 0.5, and
 DVAR(I) is a vector of random numbers between 0. and 1.0.
 This is the only formula that existed before August, 2009,
 when no index, IAUTOF, existed.

 If IAUTOF = 2 the formula used to change the vector X(i)
 in AUTOCHANGE is the same as for IAUTOF = 1 except that
 DVARS(I) =1.5*DVAR(I)-0.5 instead of DVARS(I) =2.0*DVAR(I)-0.5.


At the end of the 3rd execution of SUPEROPT the best "FEASIBLE"

The optimum designs from all three of the partial executions
of SUPEROPT are slightly different, but the difference is in
the "noise" level. An optimum design found previously, and
subsequently used to obtain prebuckling deformations,
effective stress and local and general buckling modes from
BIGBOSOR4 and from STAGS, is very like that just listed:
different only at the "noise" level. This previously
determined optimum design is archived by the GENOPT
processor, CHANGE, as follows:

The following is an explanation of why the lower and upper bounds of
the decision variables, established by the GENOPT processor, DECIDE, 
are so tight when nonlinear theory is used for optimization. The plot:
mich1.itype3.margins.yplate2.nonlinear.reoptimizedwithistrat13.ps
demonstrates the extreme sensitivity of the optimized design with
respect to the decision variable, YPLATE(2), which is the radius of
the "mich1" shell at the junction between Shell Segments 1 and 2.
(See mich1.mmm0.5.optimizedprofile.weight6.911lb.nonlinear.ps).
The tight lower and upper bounds on YPLATE(2) should be approximately
equidistant from the optimized value of YPLATE(2) determined
from optimization with the use of linear theory. (See the plot:
mich1.itype3.margins.yplate2.linear.ps). Without these tight lower
and upper bounds on YPLATE(2), executions of SUPEROPT would bomb
because of failure of the Newton iterations to converge. The
mich1.OPM file would end with the following line:

"IMODX= 0 SHELL COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY. Run abort."

A file, mich1.OUT, would remain. Near the end of this mich1.OUT
file the following lines would appear:

SHELL COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY AT P=0.6307 

 NO CONVERGENCE IN PREBUCKLING ANALYSIS AFTER 10 NEWTON ITERATIONS. LOADS FOLLOW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------''

This failure of convergence of the NEWTON method usually occurs
during the execution of SUPEROPT, during the execution of the GENOPT
processor called "OPTIMIZE" that immediately follows an execution
of the GENOPT processor called "AUTOCHANGE". (AUTOCHANGE derives a new
"starting" design consistent with lower and upper bounds of decision
variables.) If there are wide lower and upper bounds, the new
"starting" design created by AUTOCHANGE may well be too weak to
support the applied external pressure, and therefore may collapse
axisymmetrically during the pre-buckling phase of the computations.
The non-optimum, new "starting" design that "COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY"
in this particular case is as follows:

  VALUES OF DESIGN VARIABLES CORRESPONDING TO BEST FEASIBLE DESIGN
 VAR.   CURRENT
 NO.     VALUE            DEFINITION
  1    4.4842E-02  wall thickness of the major segment: THICK(1 )
  2    4.6730E+00  projected width (x-width) of major segment: SUBWID(1 )
  3    5.0000E+01  half-angle (deg.) of major corrugation: PHISEG(1 )
  4    7.0000E+01  half-angle (deg.) of sub-corrugation: PHISUB(1 )
  5    3.5000E+01  vertical y above (x,y,z) origin if PHIBIG=0: YPLATE(1 )
  6    3.9487E+01  vertical y above (x,y,z) origin if PHIBIG=0: YPLATE(2 )
  7    1.0000E-02  half-angle (deg.) of overall arching: PHIBIG

As can be seen, neither PHISEG(1) nor YPLATE(2) are close to their
optimized values obtained with the use of linear theory:

  3    34.110E+01  half-angle (deg.) of major corrugation: PHISEG(1 )
  6    32.120E+01  vertical y above (x,y,z) origin if PHIBIG=0: YPLATE(2 )

(The two values just listed appear in the file, mich1.linear.852.opm.)

The plot, mich1.loaddisplacement.yplate38_40.ps, shows nonlinear
pressure-displacement curves for PHISEG(1) = 50 degrees and for
several closely spaced values of YPLATE(2) surrounding and including
the value, YPLATE(2) = 39.487 inches. It is clear that the nonlinear
axisymmetric prebuckling behavior changes dramatically with small
changes in YPLATE(2). Without tight lower and upper bounds on
YPLATE(2) bracketing the optimized value of YPLATE(2) determined
with the use of linear theory, the nonlinear computations in
BIGBOSOR4 would frequently fail during executions of SUPEROPT.
The failure probably would occur most often in the pre-buckling
phase of the BIGBOSOR4 computations.

the plot, mich1.nonoptimumshapes.phiseg50.yplate2.38_40.ps,
shows two of the non-optimum shapes corresponding to the
extremes of behavoir displayed in the plot,
mich1.loaddisplacement.yplate38_40.ps. The plot,
mich1.mmm0.5.nonoptimum.yplate38.nonlinear.enduvs.014513.p.05.ps
shows, with greatly exaggerated amplitude the axisymmetric
pre-buckling deformation. Remember, there is no axial load
applied at the bottome of the shell structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------

How to get predictions from nonlinear theory for local bucklng:

This is a "tricky" bit. The BIGBOSOR4 model for local buckling
obtained with the use of nonlinear theory has MMM = 0.5,
that is, a "half-model" is employed. A "half-model" is
a model that includes all shell segments from the bottom
of the shell to the first symmetry plane at WIDTH/2 (axial
station close to 50 inches for the specific case "mich1").
This is done in order to avoid two very closely spaced
local buckling eigenvalues. With use of the half-model
there is no mich1.inp2 file, which ordinarily contains
STAGS input data for a model with MMM = 1, that is a STAGS
model that covers an axial length equal to WIDTH = 100 inches.
However, we want to obtain a STAGS nonlinear prediction
of local buckling from a model with MMM = 1. In order
to do this we go back to the beginning (to BEGIN) as
follows:
cleanspec
begin
change  (NOTE: change re-establishes the archived
         optimized model obtained from nonlinear
         theory, not the archived optimized model
         from linear theory.)
decide
mainsetup   (NPRINT = 2; ITYPE = 2 for "fixed" design)
optimize    (yields the prediction from linear theory
             for the optimized model obtained from
             nonlinear theory)
Now we have the input file, mich1.inp2, which is the
STAGS model with MMM = 1 used for local buckling.
We run STAGS in the nonlinear mode (STAGS analysis
type INDIC = 3 as follows:
cd /home/stags/stagsops (working directory for STAGS)

Some information about the nonlinear analysis of the specific case mich8u:

 PHISEG(1) = variable no. 17; data in mich8u.nonlinear.istrat5.dec:
        17      $ Choose a decision variable (1,2,3,...)
        20      $ Lower bound of variable no.( 17)
        50      $ Upper bound of variable no.( 17)

The mich8u.CHG file used for the following computations is
that corresponding to the best FEASIBLE design determined
with the use of nonlinear strategy: ISTRAT = 5

istrat5
nonlinear.istrat5 on SUPEROPT iteration no. 129 immediately after AUTOCHANGE.
The diagnostic given at the end of the mich8u.OPM file is as follows:
 IMODX= 0 SHELL COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY. Run abort.

 The best optimum design is stored in mich8u.CHG = mich8u.nonlinear.652.chg
 The best FEASIBLE design after 128 iterations weights 57.657 lb and will
be used as the starting design in the following 3 ISTRAT7 runs.
The plot of the objective vs design iterations is stored in the file:
mich8u.nonlinear.istrat5.652.ps


istrat7
With the same mich8u.DEC, mich8u.CHG, and mich8u.OPT files the SUPEROPT run keeps
going but fails to accumulate designs in the STORE processor. There is no
diagnostic message, either at the end of the mich8u.OPM file or at
the end of the mich8u.OUT file. The design appears to be stuck
in a very UNFEASIBLE state, that is, the general buckling load
factor is trapped around -0.9. There are no error diagnostics, but
something is clearly very wrong. ISTRAT = 7 yields a very, very different
design margin (about -0.9) for general buckling than the ISTRAT = 5
strategy (0.002586) for the identical design.

With the same mich8u.DEC file, mich8u.CHG file and a mich8u.OPT file
with "1562" strategy the SUPEROPT run bombs at iteration no. 134
immediately after AUTOCHANGE. The diagnostic given at the end
of the mich8u.OPM file is as follows:
 IMODX= 0 SHELL COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY. Run abort.

With the same mich8u.DEC file, mich8u.CHG file and a mich8u.OPT file 
with "1542" strategy the SUPEROPT run bombs at iteration no. 288 .
The best FEASIBLE design weighs 61.72 lb, and will be used as the
starting design in the next ISTRAT=7 run. At Iteration No. 288
when the SUPEROPT run bombs there exists at the end of the
mich8u.OUT file the following diagnostic:

 In EBAND2: ISKIPR = 13
 The load has been reduced too many times because of
 skipped roots. Run will now abort.

The plot of the objective vs design iterations is stored in the file:
mich8u.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.ps


Another ISTRAT7 run, using the same mich8u.BEG and mich8u.DEC and
mich8u.OPT files as before. The mich8u.CHG file was changed to
the following: mich8u.CHG = mich8u.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.chg
The SUPEROPT run bombed on Iteration No. 16, just after
an execution of AUTOCHANGE. The diagnostic that appears at the
bottom of the mich8u.OPM file is as follows:
 IMODX= 0 SHELL COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY. Run abort.


istrat13
This is the most rigorous nonlinear strategy, in which the
BIGBOSOR4 analysis type indicator, INDIC = -2 for both local
buckling and general buckling. Because of very closely spaced
eigenvalues for local buckling, the optimization cannot even
get started. During processing for 0 iterations, SUPEROPT
bombs with the following diagnostic at the bottom of the
mich8u.OUT file:

 In EBAND2: ISKIPR = 13
 The load has been reduced too many times because of
 skipped roots. Run will now abort.

However, the analysis of the "fixed" design, that
corresponding to the archived configuration stored
in the file: mich8u.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.chg
runs to successful completion. The relevant files
are stored in the following:
mich8u.nonlinear.istrat13.beg
mich8u.nonlinear.istrat13.dec
mich8u.nonlinear.istrat13.opt
and the best FEASIBLE, design, same as that from
the istrat7 optimization has the following design
margins and weight:
MARGIN CURRENT
 NO.     VALUE            DEFINITION
  1   -7.440E-02  (LOCBUK(1 )/LOCBUKA(1 )) / LOCBUKF(1 )-1; F.S.=  1.60
  2    3.402E-03  (BUKSYM(1 )/BUKSYMA(1 )) / BUKSYMF(1 )-1; F.S.=  1.40

There is another diagnostic but this one did not appear
in any of mich8u output files. It would appear at the
end of the mich8u.OUT file. This is the diagnostic:

 **************** NOTE OF ABORT *****************
 In EBAND2. ITHIS.GT.20 Therefore abort the run.
 Probably aborting because roots have been skipped
 too many times in the search for the lowest
 eigenvalue. There probably exist really close
 eigenvalues near the lowest eigenvalue.
 WRDCOL= TOO MANY LOAD REDUCTIONS. Abort in EBAND2


In an "itype3" run (ITYPE = 3, design sensitivity
of the optimized design) mich8u got into an infinite
loop if PHISEG(1) exceeded 35 degrees at the upper
end of its range. The reason for the glitch is unknown.

-----------------------------------------------------

mich8

Executions of computer runs in which optimization
is performed are much longer than with the previous
specific cases, mich1, mich1b and mich8u because
there are many more decision variables. Now the
decision variables are as follows:
THICK(1)
SUBWID(1), SUBWID(2),..., SUBWID(8)
PHISEG(1), PHISEG(2),..., PHISEG(8)
YPLATE(1), YPLATE(2),..., YPLATE(9)

The starting design is the same as the final
design for mich8u. Optimization is attempted
with ISTRAT = 7 (INDIC=1 for local buckling,
INDIC = -2 for general buckling). The factor
of safety for local buckling is 1.6.
The starting design is archived in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.beg
The initial mich8.DEC file is archived in:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.dec

istrat7
The SUPEROPT run bombs at Iteration No. 46 after
only three executions of OPTIMIZE with 15 iterations
each (1542 strategy). The best FEASIBLE design
weighs 57.776 lb. The diagnostic at the end of the
mich8.OUT file is:

 In EBAND2: ISKIPR = 13
 The load has been reduced too many times because of
 skipped roots. Run will now abort.

which indicates very closely spaced eigenvalues.
A plot of objective versus design iterations is
given in the file: 
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.objective.15iterations.ps
The optimized design is archived in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.chg
and the optimized design gives the results in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.opm

istrat5
The SUPEROPT run bombs at Iteration No. 226. As before,
the 1542 strategy was used with 15 iterations. The best
FEASIBLE design weighs 51.51 lb. The diagnostic at the
bottom of the mich8.OPM file is as follows:
IMODX= 0 SHELL COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY. Run abort.
A plot of objective versus design iterations is
archived in the file: 
mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.objective.15iterations.ps
The optimized design is archived in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg
and the optimized design gives the results in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.opm

istrat7 again
Starting from mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg, corresponding
to which the general buckling load factor with istrat7 instead
of istrat5 is -0.8something, a converged optimum design is
not found. The 1542 strategy with 15 iterations was used.
After 115 design iterations the SUPEROPT run bombs
with the following diagnostic:
IMODX= 0 SHELL COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY. Run abort.
printed at the end of the mich8.OPM file. Iterations hovered
around a weight of about 120 lb with almost all of them
labeled "NOT FEASIBLE". This is far above the weight of 57.776 lb
obtained as the best FEASIBLE design under the previous
optimization with istrat7. The plot of objective versus
design iterations was never archived.

istrat1
The factor of safety for local buckling is increased from
1.6 to 2.0 because we are ignoring the effect of geometric
nonlinearity.
Starting again from mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg, corresponding
to which the general buckling load factor with istrat1 instead
of istrat5 is -0.8something, SUPERDUPEROPT is executed with use
of the 652 strategy with 5 iterations. Three successive executions
of SUPEROPT are specified. The input files are
mich8.linear.istrat1.beg
mich8.linear.istrat1.dec
mich8.linear.istrat1.opt.
Corresponding to the three successive executions of SUPEROPT
in the long SUPERDUPEROPT run, the three plots of objective
(WEIGHT) versus design iteration are:
mich8.linear.istrat1.652.objective.superopt1.5iterations.ps
mich8.linear.istrat1.652.objective.superopt2.5iterations.ps
mich8.linear.istrat1.652.objective.superopt3.5iterations.ps
Because linear theory is used (istrat=1) SUPEROPT never bombs.
The final best FEASIBLE design weighs 83.89 lb, far too high.
It is a local minimum weight, not even close to a "global"
minimum weight. The 652 strategy with 5 iterations is too crude:
allows too large a move limit (IMOVE=5), does not use enough
design iterations per execution of OPTIMIZE (5) and does not use
enougth OPTIMIZEs/AUTOCHANGE (6).

istrat1 again
Starting again from mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg, corresponding
to which the general buckling load factor with istrat1 instead
of istrat5 is -0.8something, SUPEROPT is executed with use
of the 1542 strategy with 15 iterations. A plot of objective
versus design iteration is represented by the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.objective.superopt1.15iterations.ps
The optimized design from linear theory is represented by the
two files:
mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.chg
mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.opm
The best FEASIBLE optimum design weighs 57.12 lb.

There are two questions raised by the plot of objective versus
design iteration (mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.objective.superopt1.ps):

1. Why at Iteration No. 15 is there a disproportionate jump from
an objective of 57.04 to 62.75, a jump of 10 per cent?

2. Why over the successive 200 or so iterations is there a gradual
upward climb of the objective?

For an answer to the first question it is useful to list results
from the first execution of OPTIMIZE in the SUPEROPT run:
 ==============================================================
 ITERATION                                        NUMBER OF

 =============================================================================
The values of objective versus design iteration listed above
are plotted in the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.objective.optimize1.15iterations.ps
It is clear from the above list and from the corresponding
plot that the jump between the second-to-last
and the last iteration is out of proportion with the trend in the
previous iterations. The disproportional jump is caused by
entry into an "escape" strategy introduced into GENOPT. The
"escape" strategy is used in two situations:
1. when the current design is very bad, that is, one or more of
the design margins is less than -0.95.
2. when the current design is worse than "ALMOST FEASIBLE"
yet, in spite of that, the following diagnostic appears: 
"ADS DID NOT CHANGE THE DESIGN"
In other words, the design is stuck in an unacceptable region
of design space.
Whenever the "escape" strategy is invoked in GENOPT all
variables identified by the End User in DECIDE as "escape variables"
are automatically increased by 10 per cent. "Escape variables"
are variables that, when increased, move the design toward the
feasible region of design space. In problems that involve buckling
or vibration frequencies or stress in shells the only suitable
"escape variables" are thicknesses. In DECIDE the following
prompts occur near the end of the interactive input session:
   y      $ Any escape variables (Y or N) ?
   y      $ Want to have escape variables chosen by default?
The default option automatically identifies thicknesses as
"escape variables" provided that the GENOPT User has used the
string, "thickness" or "Thickness" or "THICKNESS" as part of
the definition of a decision variable that is a thickness.

An answer to the second question raised above:
2. Why over the successive 200 or so iterations is there a gradual
upward climb of the objective?
is not known for certain. It appears that disproportionally
large changes in decision variables are required to raise
the design margins only a very small amount. Details should
be explored at a later time.

istrat1 yet again
Starting yet again from mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg, corresponding
to which the general buckling load factor with istrat1 instead
of istrat5 is -0.8something, SUPEROPT is executed with use
of the 542 strategy with 15 iterations/optimize. A plot of
objective versus design iteration is represented by the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.542.objective.superopt1.15iterations.ps
From the plot of objective versus design iteration it seems
clear that the use of only 5 OPTIMIZEs/AUTOCHANGE is not enough.
The best FEASIBLE design weighs 61.17 lb.

istrat1 and yet again
Starting and yet again from mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg, corresponding
to which the general buckling load factor with istrat1 instead
of istrat5 is -0.8something, SUPEROPT is executed with use
of the 552 strategy with 15 iterations/optimize. A plot of
objective versus design iteration is represented by the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.552.objective.superopt1.15iterations.ps
The plot starts at Iteration No. 17 instead of Iteration No. 0,
because the value of the objective has been set to zero for
the first 16 iterations, and zero values are not plotted.
This happens if all the designs during the initial executions
of OPTIMIZE are NOT FEASIBLE.
The best FEASIBLE design weighs 60.0 lb.

istrat1 and yet once more 
Starting and yet again from mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg, corresponding
to which the general buckling load factor with istrat1 instead
of istrat5 is -0.8something, SUPEROPT is executed with use
of the 552 strategy with 5 iterations/OPTIMIZE. A plot of
objective versus design iteration is represented by the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.552.objective.superopt1.5iterations.ps
The plot starts at Iteration No. 67 instead of Iteration No. 0,
because the value of the objective has been set to zero for
the first 66 iterations, and zero values are not plotted.
This happens if all the designs during the initial executions
of OPTIMIZE are NOT FEASIBLE.
Not enough iterations/OPTIMIZE are permitted and the initial
move limit, IMOVE = 5, is too liberal. Therefore,
the best FEASIBLE design 
weighs 80.85 lb and the best ALMOST FEASIBLE design weighs
68.74 lb, significantly higher than previously determined
optimized best FEASIBLE designs that weigh between 57.71 lb and
61.17 lb.

istrat1 and yet another once more
Starting and yet again from mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg, corresponding
to which the general buckling load factor with istrat1 instead
of istrat5 is -0.8something, SUPEROPT is executed with use
of the 852 strategy with 8 iterations/OPTIMIZE. A plot of
objective versus design iteration is represented by the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.852.objective.superopt1.8iterations.ps
The best FEASIBLE design weights 67.77 lb and the best
ALMOST FEASIBLE design weighs 65.98 lb, significantly higher
than previousl determined optimized best FEASIBLE designs that
weight between 57.71 and 61.17 lb.

istrat1 with the factor of safety for local buckling = 1.6 
Starting from the archived configuration represented by
the file, mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.chg , we decreased the
factor of safety for local buckling from 2.0 to 1.6 and
obtain the following after an execution of SUPEROPT:
mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.objective.superopt1.15iterations.fs1.6.ps
The final optimized weight is 52.61 lb. The best FEASIBLE
optimum design is archived in the file

istrat1 with the factor of safety for local buckling = 1.6
Starting from the archived configuration represented by
the file, mich8.old.chg . We use the strategy 3062 with
15 iterations. The plot of objective versus design iteration
is archived in the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.3062.objective.superopt1.15iterations.fs1.6.fromoldchg.ps
The final optimized weight is 49.41 lb. The best FEASIBLE

istrat13 applied to the same design archived in the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.3062.fs1.6.fromoldchg.chg
An OPTIMIZE run with the "fixed" optimized design
bombs in the section on local buckling with
the diagnostic:
 In EBAND2: ISKIPR = 13
 The load has been reduced too many times because of
 skipped roots. Run will now abort.
However, local buckling roots (eigenvalues) were detected
between load factors 1.50 and 1.55.

STAGS: general buckling, linear theory
The optimized configuration analyzed by STAGS
is that archived in the files:
mich8.linear.istrat1.3062.fs1.6.startingfromoldchg.chg
mich8.linear.istrat1.3062.fs1.6.startingfromoldchg.opm
The critical buckling mode and load factor from the linear
bifurcation buckling STAGS run (STAGS analysis type indicator,
INDIC = 1) are displayed in the file:
mich8.stags.linear.genbuck.weight49.41.eig0.95464.pdf
The critical general buckling load factor from STAGS, 0.95464,
is significantly lower than that predicted from the
BIGBOSOR4 linear theory:
  2    1.406E+00    symmetric general buckling: BUKSYM(1 )

********************************************************
******************** March 12, 2014 *** ****************
A major change in problem formulation is required:

It was found by running STAGS on an optimized design
that weighed 49.41 lb that the general linear buckling load
from STAGS was 0.95464 whereas BIGBOSOR4 predicted
about 1.4. It was found that the difference was caused
by different boundary conditions being used in the STAGS
versus BIGBOSOR4 models for general buckling:
STAGS had antisymmetry at the end ("top") of the shell,
whereas BIGBOSOR4 had symmetry at this axial station.
A BIGBOSOR4 case was set up for the same design in
which antisymmetry was used at the "top" of the shell.
Then both BIGBOSOR4 and STAGS obtained the lower
general buckling load factor, about 0.96.

Whereas in previous computations BUKASY (antisymmetric
buckling) was not been computed in the generic
"michelin" BIGBOSOR4 model because it was
mistakenly thought that the antisymmetric and symmetric
models would yield essentially the same general
buckling load factors for such a long shell (MMM=3)
in which the buckling mode has multiple axial half-
waves. Since the present optimized
shell demonstrates convincingly that that assumption
does not always hold, it was necessary to modify
behavior.michelin and bosdec.michelin to permit
both symmetric (BUKSYM and *.inp3) and antisymmetric
(BUKASY and *.inp4) BIGBOSOR4 and STAGS models.
This has now been done, but, since there is an
additional active behavoral constraint (BUKASY)
that has not been computed until now, it is
necessary to go back and re-optimize many
configurations previously optimized in the
absence of the BUKASY behavioral constraint.
***************************************************

With behavior.michelin and bosdec.michelin updated,
and starting from the previously archived design:
mich8.linear.istrat1.3062.fs1.6.startingfromoldchg.chg
we obtain, from a single execution of OPTIMIZE with
use of the 1542 strategy/15 iterations, the following

Design Sensitivity "Surface":
A design sensitivity "surface" was obtained. The anti-symmetric
general buckling margin is plotted for various values of
YPLATE(1) and YPLATE(9), two decision variables which exhibit
the most extreme design sensitivity. The relevant files
are as follows:
mich8.y1y9surface.input
mich8.y1y9surface.ps
The plot contains 16 traces corresponding to closely spaced
values of YPLATE(1) from 34.03 inches to 35.53 inches, with
the YPLATE(1) interval equal to 0.1 inch. Each trace covers
the range 29.5 < YPLATE(9) > 33.5 inches.

Plotting the critical buckling modes for local, general symmetric
buckling and general antisymmetric buckling for the optimized
design and for a design that is slightly different from the
optimized design (YPLATE(1) changed from its optimized value,
35.53 inches, to a slightly lower (non-optimum) value, 34.5
inches). The extreme sensitivity of local and general buckling
to a small change in the design is demonstrated. The
relevant files are as follows:

The starting design is again the final mich8u
design, that is, the mich8u design archived in
the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.beg

The SUPEROPT run bombs at Iteration No. 46 after
only three executions of OPTIMIZE with 15 iterations
each (1542 strategy). The best FEASIBLE design
weighs 56.818 lb, as written in the mich8.OPP
file corresponding to Iteration No. 45:
    45         5.6818E+01         FEASIBLE            4

The diagnostic at the end of the
mich8.OUT file is:

 **************** NOTE OF ABORT *****************
 In EBAND2. ITHIS.GT.20 Therefore abort the run.
 Probably aborting because roots have been skipped
 too many times in the search for the lowest
 eigenvalue. There probably exist really close
 eigenvalues near the lowest eigenvalue.
 WRDCOL= TOO MANY LOAD REDUCTIONS. Abort in EBAND2

which indicates very closely spaced eigenvalues.
A plot of objective versus design iterations is
given in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.objective.15iterations.new.ps
The optimized design is archived in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.new.chg
and the optimized design gives the results in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.new.opm

istrat5
The SUPEROPT run bombs at Iteration No. 223. As before,
the 1542 strategy was used with 15 iterations. The best
FEASIBLE design weighs 55.32 lb. The diagnostic at the
bottom of the mich8.OPM file is as follows:
IMODX= 0 SHELL COLLAPSES AXISYMMETRICALLY. Run abort.
A plot of objective versus design iterations is
archived in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.objective.15iterations.new.ps
The optimized design is archived in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.new.chg
and the optimized design gives the results in the file:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.new.opm

istrat1
The factor of safety for local buckling is increased
from 1.6 to 2.0.
Starting from mich8.nonlinear.istrat5.1542.chg, corresponding
to which the general buckling load factors with istrat1 instead
of istrat5 are both about -0.4, SUPEROPT is executed with use
of the 1542 strategy with 15 iterations. A plot of objective
versus design iteration is represented by the file:
mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.objective.superopt1.15iterations.new.ps
The optimized design from linear theory is represented by the
two files:
mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.new.chg
mich8.linear.istrat1.1542.new.opm
The best FEASIBLE optimum design weighs 60.12 lb.


istrat7 optimized design analyzed by STAGS:
Starting from the archived design:
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.new.chg
(WEIGHT=56.82 lb) and with the use of
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.beg
the optimized "fixed" design
mich8.nonlinear.istrat7.1542.new.opm
was processed, and STAGS models were
run corresponding to mich8.inp, mich8.inp3
and mich8.inp4. The predictions from STAGS
are stored in the following files:

General buckling (anti-symmetric buckling):
mich8.stags.nonlinear.genbuck.weight56.82eig1.41555.inp4.pdf

General buckling (symmetric buckling (did not work
because rigid body modes are not prevented):
mich8.stags.linear.genbuck.weight56.82.eig0.04.rigidbodytranslation.inp3.pdf
mich8.stags.linear.genbuck.weight56.82.eig0.38.rigidbodyrolling.inp3.pdf

Local Buckling with MMM = 0.5 (mich8.inp works only because
in this particular optimized configuration there happen
to be no "smoothing" segments, that is, the STAGS model
is generated in SUBROUTINE BOSDEC. In SUBROUTINE BOSDEC
STAGS models (*.inp) are generated with "smoothing"
segments not accounted for. "Smoothing" segments are
generally present in optimized configurations.
It is only by chance that the mich8.inp STAGS input file
is appropriate for this particular optimized configuration
in which "smoothing" segments happen not to be needed).
mich8.stags.nonlinear.locbuck.weight56.82.eig1.5195.inp.pdf

Local Buckling with MMM = 1.0 (mich8.inp2 always works because
"smoothing" segments are accounted for, that is, the STAGS
model is generated from SUBROUTINE BOSDEC2. SUBROUTINE
BOSDEC2 always includes "smoothing" segments, which
are generally present in optimized configurations.):
mich8.stags.nonlinear.locbuck.weight56.82.eig1.4905.inp2.pdf
This case is run by means of a "trick": With the use of
nonlinear theory (BIGBOSOR4 analysis type indicator, INDIC,
is less than 3) there exists no mich8.inp2 file because
only SUBROUTINE BOSDEC is used to generate the STAGS
model and SUBROUTINE BOSDEC only generates the STAGS
input file, mich8.inp (MMM=0.5), in which "smoothing"
segments are never present. Therefore, the linear
BIGBOSOR4 model (INDIC = 4) is processed. In the linear
model mich8.inp2 does exist, and it is this mich8.inp2
file that is used for processing with STAGS in a
nonlinear mode (STAGS analysis type indicator, INDIC=3).
