 The decision variable candidates are:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 1. The thickness, THICK, assumed to be constant over
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 each major segment, but can be different in each major segment. 
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 2. The projected width, SUBWID, of each major segment. This
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 is the width of the major panel segment projected onto the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 x,z plane, that is, the "x-width" of the major segment.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 3. The half-angles, PHISEG(i), of the major corrugation
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 segments. "half-angle" (in degrees) means half the angle
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 spanned by a single cylindrical corrugation segment of the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 corrugated panel. The major segments are joined width-wise
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 longitudinal edge-to-edge. The edges all around the perimeter
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of the corrugated panel are simply supported. NOTE: The
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 left-hand longitudinal edge has the three displacement
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 components, USTAR,VSTAR,WSTAR, constrained and the rotation
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 about the generator, CHI, free. USTAR, VSTAR, WSTAR are the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 vertical (y-direction), axial (z-direction), and width-wise
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (x-direction) displacement components, respectively.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 The two curved edges at z = 0 and z = LENGTH are simply
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 supported in the classical sense, that is, buckling is
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 antisymmetric about those two edges. Another way of
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 expressing this is to write that buckling nodal lines
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 occur along the two edges at z = 0 and z = LENGTH.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 4. The half-angles, PHISUB(i) (degrees), of the sub-segments.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 The longitudinal edges of each sub-segment have the same
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 y-coordinates of the major segment that would exist if
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 there were no sub-segments. PHISUB(i) is half the angle
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 spanned by a sub-corrugation in the ith major segment.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 All the sub-corrugations within a given major segment
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 have the same value of PHISUB. PHISUB(i) can be different
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in different major segments. The thicknesses of all sub-
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 corrugations in a given major segment are the same.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 5. The distances, YPLATE, that the junctions of the major
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 segments and the two longitudinal edges of the model, the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 leftmost edge at x = 0 and the rightmost edge at x=WIDTH/2,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 are raised above the x,z plane if the overall arching
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 angle, PHIBIG (defined next), is zero. If PHIBIG is greater
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 than zero YPLATE are the vertical distances above the overall
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 arch at the x-locations of the junctions of the major segments
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 and at the left-most and right-most edges of the panel.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 YPLATE is a vector with NSEG+1 components, in which NSEG
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 is the number of major segments over the width, WIDTH/2.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 6. An overall arching half-angle, PHIBIG (degrees), that
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 spans the distance, WIDTH/2, of the corrugated panel. The
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 top of the arch (or bottom of the "valley") is located at
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 The variables, V(6), V(7), V(8), V(9), V(10), are the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 projected widths, SUBWID(1), SUBWID(2), SUBWID(3), SUBWID(4)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 and SUBWID(5), of the 5 major segments. These 5 variables
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 are decision variables, and the sum of them should always
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 be very close to the half-width, WIDTH/2, of the corrugated
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 panel. In order to accomplish this, two inequality
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 constraints are introduced during execution of the GENOPT
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 processor called "DECIDE":
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 1. The overall half-width should be less than 50.5 inches.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 2. The overall half-width should be greater than 49.5 inches.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 In other words,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 50.5 > V(6) + V(7) + V(8) + V(9) + V(10)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 and
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 49.5 < V(6) + V(7) + V(8) + V(9) + V(10)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 During the development of this application it was found
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 that the numerical behavior was improved by multiplying
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 both sides of the two inequality constraints by 0.1.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Therefore, the two new (equivalent) inequality constraints
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 are:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 5.05 > 0.1*V(6) + 0.1*V(7) + 0.1*V(8) + 0.1*V(9) + 0.1*V(10)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 4.95 < 0.1*V(6) + 0.1*V(7) + 0.1*V(8) + 0.1*V(9) + 0.1*V(10)

 603.2
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
       The inequality relations have either of the two forms:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
           Type 1 is:     1.0 > f(v1,v2,v3,...)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
           Type 2 is:     1.0 < f(v1,v2,v3,...)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
       in which the expression f(v1,v2,v3,...) has the form:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
       f(v1,v2,v3,...)=C0 +C1*v1**D1 +C2*v2**D2 +C3*v3**D3 +
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
                              +etc (up to max. of 15 terms).
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 In this application we always use inequality constraints of
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Type 2: 1.0 < f(v1,v2,v3,...). Therefore, we multiply both
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 sides of the first inequality constraint by -1.0, obtaining
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 -5.05 < -0.1*V(6) -0.1*V(7) -0.1*V(8) -0.1*V(9) -0.1*V(10)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Adding 5.05 to both sides of this first inequality gives:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 0.0 <  5.05 -0.1*V(6) -0.1*V(7) -0.1*V(8) -0.1*V(9) -0.1*V(10)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 and then adding 1.0 to both sides of this inequality gives:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 1.0 <  6.05 -0.1*V(6) -0.1*V(7) -0.1*V(8) -0.1*V(9) -0.1*V(10)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 which is in the proper Type 2 form: 1.0 < f(v1,v2,v3,...).
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Subtracting 4.95 from both sides of the second inequality
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 and then adding 1.0 to both sides of the second inequality
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 gives:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 1.0 < -3.95 +0.1*V(6) +0.1*V(7) +0.1*V(8) +0.1*V(9) +0.1*V(10)

 The "huge torus" or "huge corrugated annulus" model is a

 of PRISMATIC shells. As of 2010, BIGBOSOR4 now has two

 The INDIC = 4, IPRE = 0 branch of BIGBOSOR4 is used for the

 local and general buckling analyses. The maximum stress is

 computed as if the corrugated panel were subjected
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to uniform end shortening. The prebuckled state of the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 corrugated panel is a membrane state (no prebuckling

 bending). The prebuckling axial stress resultant is
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 everywhere proportional to the wall thickness. Since in the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 present model the thickness, THICK(i), is uniform in the ith

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 There is no width-wise resultant because, under the

 of the axial length, LENGTH, to be used in the model for

 LOCAL buckling of the corrugated panel. FACLEN (should be

 required to find the critical (lowest) LOCAL buckling load
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 because there are fewer axial halfwaves in the

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Note that FACLEN is the same for all the panel segments.

 NSEG is the number of MAJOR cylindrical segments over

 Perhaps one should give a value MHIGHGA=10 (or something

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 1. Thickness, THICK, of a major cylindrical segment, assumed
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to be constant in each major segment of the corrugated panel.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 THICK is a one-dimensional array: THICK(i), i = 1, 2, ..NSEG,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in which NSEG = the number of major segments over WIDTH/2.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 panel. SUBWID is the width of a cylindrical major segment as

 sigma(critical) = (EMOD*THICK/RADIUS)/SQRT[3(1-NU**2)]
