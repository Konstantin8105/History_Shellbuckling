C YOU ARE USING WHAT I HAVE CALLED "GENOPT" TO GENERATE AN
C OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM FOR A PARTICULAR CLASS OF PROBLEMS.
C THE NAME YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR THIS CLASS OF PROBLEMS IS: span9

C "GENOPT" (GENeral OPTimization) was written during 1987-1988
C by Dr. David Bushnell, Dept. 93-30, Bldg. 315, (415)424-3237
C    Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., 3315 Hanover St.,
C    Palo Alto, California, USA  94304

C The optimizer used in GENOPT is called ADS, and was
C written by G. Vanderplaats [3]. It is based on the method
C of feasible directions [4].

C                       ABSTRACT

C "GENOPT" has the following purposes and properties:
C     1. Any relatively simple analysis is "automatically"
C        converted into an optimization of whatever system
C        can be analyzed with fixed properties. Please note
C        that GENOPT is not intended to be used for problems
C        that require elaborate data-base management systems
C        or large numbers of degrees of freedom.

C     2. The optimization problems need not be in fields nor
C        jargon familiar to me, the developer of GENOPT.
C        Although all of the example cases (See the cases
C        in the directories under genopt/case)
C        are in the field of structural analysis, GENOPT is
C        not limited to that field.


C     3. GENOPT is a program that writes other programs. These
C        programs, WHEN AUGMENTED BY USER-SUPPLIED CODING,
C        form a program system that should be user-friendly in
C        the GENOPT-user"s field. In this instance the user
C        of GENOPT must later supply FORTRAN coding that
C        calculates behavior in the problem class called "span9".

C     4. Input data and textual material are elicited from
C        the user of GENOPT in a general enough way so that
C        he or she may employ whatever data, definitions, and
C        "help" paragraphs will make subsequent use of the
C        program system thus generated easy by those less
C        familiar with the class of problems "span9" than
C        the GENOPT user.

C     5. The program system generated by GENOPT has the same
C        general architecture as previous programs written for
C        specific applications by the developer [7 - 16]. That
C        is, the command set is:

C           BEGIN     (User supplies starting design, loads,
C                      control integers, material properties,
C                      etc. in an interactive-help mode.)

C           DECIDE    (User chooses decision and linked
C                      variables and inequality constraints
C                      that are not based on behavior.)

C           MAINSETUP (User chooses output option, whether
C                      to perform analysis of a fixed design
C                      or to optimize, and number of design
C                      iterations.)

C           OPTIMIZE  (The program system performs, in a batch
C                      mode, the work specified in MAINSETUP.)

C           SUPEROPT  (Program tries to find the GLOBAL optimum
C                      design as described in Ref.[11] listed
C                      below (Many OPTIMIZEs in one run.)

C           CHANGE    (User changes certain parameters)

C           CHOOSEPLOT (User selects which quantities to plot
C                       vs. design iterations.)

C           DIPLOT    (User generates plots)

C           CLEANSPEC (User cleans out unwanted files.)

C     A typical runstream is:
C       GENOPTLOG   (activate command set)
C       BEGIN       (provide starting design, loads, etc.)
C       DECIDE      (choose decision variables and bounds)
C       MAINSETUP   (choose print option and analysis type)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       CHANGE      (change some variables for new starting pt)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       CHOOSEPLOT  (choose which variables to plot)
C       DIPLOT      (plot variables v. iterations)
C       CHOOSEPLOT  (choose additional variables to plot)
C       DIPLOT      (plot more variables v design iterations)
C       CLEANSPEC   (delete extraneous files for specific case)

C  IMPORTANT:  YOU MUST ALWAYS GIVE THE COMMAND "OPTIMIZE"
C              SEVERAL TIMES IN SUCCESSION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN
C              CONVERGENCE! AN EXPLANATION OF WHY YOU MUST DO
C              THIS IS GIVEN ON P 580-582 OF THE PAPER "PANDA2,
C              PROGRAM FOR MINIMUM WEIGHT DESIGN OF STIFFENED,
C              COMPOSITE LOCALLY BUCKLED PANELS", Computers and
C              Structures, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605 (1987).

C Due to introduction of a "global" optimizer, SUPEROPT,
C described in Ref.[11], you can now use the runstream

C      BEGIN       (provide starting design, loads, etc.)
C      DECIDE      (choose decision variables and bounds)
C      MAINSETUP   (choose print option and analysis type)
C      SUPEROPT    (launch batch run for "global" optimization)
C      CHOOSEPLOT  (choose which variables to plot)
C      DIPLOT      (plot variables v. iterations)

C "Global" is in quotes because SUPEROPT does its best to find
C a true global optimum design. The user is strongly urged to
C execute SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT several times in succession in
C order to determine an optimum that is essentially just as
C good as the theoretical true global optimum. Each execution
C of the series,
C      SUPEROPT
C      CHOOSEPLOT

C does the following:

C 1. SUPEROPT executes many sets of the two processors,
C    OPTIMIZE and AUTOCHANGE (AUTOCHANGE gets a new random
C    "starting" design), in which each set does the following:

C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      AUTOCHANGE        (get new starting design randomly)

C    SUPEROPT keeps repeating the above sequence until the
C    total number of design iterations reaches about 270.
C    The number of OPTIMIZEs per AUTOCHANGE is user-provided.

C 2. CHOOSEPLOT allows the user to plot stuff and resets the
C    total number of design iterations from SUPEROPT to zero.
C    After each execution of SUPEROPT the user MUST execute
C    CHOOSEPLOT: before the next execution of SUPEROPT the
C    total number of design iterations MUST be reset to zero.

C There is a "new" GENOPT processor called "SUPERDUPEROPT".
C SUPERDUPEROPT executes SUPEROPT several times in
C succession. The user specifies the number of successive
C executions of SUPEROPT and the number of successive
C executions of OPTIMIZE between each execution of
C the GENOPT processor, AUTOCHANGE, which gets a new
C "starting" design from a random process. See Item No. 43,
C dated July 2011, in the file, ...genopt/doc/genopt.news,
C for more details about how SUPERDUPEROPT works.

C       TABLE 3   SEVEN ROLES THAT VARIABLES PLAY
C==============================================================
C    A variable can have one of the following roles:
C
C    1 = a possible decision variable for optimization,
C        typically a dimension of a structure.
C    2 = a constant parameter (cannot vary as design evolves),
C        typically a control integer or material property,
C        but not a load, allowable, or factor of safety,
C        which are asked for later.
C    3 = a parameter characterizing the environment, such
C        as a load component or a temperature.
C    4 = a quantity that describes the response of the
C        structure, (e.g. stress, buckling load, frequency)
C    5 = an allowable, such as maximum allowable stress,
C        minimum allowable frequency, etc.
C    6 = a factor of safety
C    7 = the quantity that is to be minimized or maximized,
C        called the "objective function" (e.g. weight).
C ===========================================================

 The purpose of GENTEXT is to generate a file of
 prompting phrases and helps called span9.PRO and five
 FORTRAN source libraries, BEGIN.NEW, STOGET.NEW, STRUCT.NEW,
 BEHAVIOR.NEW, and CHANGE.NEW.  The purposes of these files are
 as follows:

 ==============================================================
 TABLE 4   FILE OF PROMPTING PHRASES AND HELPS AND
           SOURCE CODE LIBRARIES GENERATED BY "GENTEXT"
 ==============================================================
  span9.PRO   = prompt file for input data for the problem
                class that you wish to set up for optimization.
                When BEGIN asks you for the name of the generic
                file, you should respond in this case with span9.

                The Prompt Numbers listed in TABLE 2 correspond
                to the prompts in this file.

  BEGIN.NEW   = source library for FORTRAN program which will
                be used to set up the starting design, material
                properties, and any other data you wish.

  STOGET.NEW  = source library for FORTRAN subroutines which
                are used to transfer labelled common blocks.
                These labelled common blocks are the data base.

  STRUCT.NEW  = source library for FORTRAN subroutines that
                perform the analysis for each iterate in the
                set of optimization iterations.  You may have
                to complete this routine (add dimension state-
                ments, subroutine calls, output statements,
                etc.).  The library, STRUCT.NEW, also contains
                a skeletal routine, SUB. TRANFR, that you can
                complete in order to translate data names from
                from those just established by you (TABLE 2) to
                other names used by the developer of previously
                written code that you may plan to incorporate
                into SUBROUTINE STRUCT and/or SUBROUTINES
                BEHX1, BEHX2, BEHX3,...BEHXn (described next).


  BEHAVIOR.NEW= a library of subroutine skeletons, BEHX1,BEHX2,
                BEHX3,...BEHXn, that, upon completion by you,
                will calculate behavior for a given design or
                design perturbation.  Skeletal subroutines for
                a user-written constraint condition, USRCON,
                and a skeletal routine for the objective func-
                tion, OBJECT, are also generated and are
                included in the BEHAVIOR.NEW library.

  CHANGE.NEW  = FORTRAN program that permits you to change
                certain program parameters without having to
                go back to BEGIN and run a case from scratch.

                          the INSERT processor.
 ============================================================


 WHAT TO DO NEXT (THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT!):
 Next, if necessary, provide the algorithms called for in the
 skeletal subroutines listed in the library BEHAVIOR.NEW. You
 may find useful routines, such as a linear interpolator,
 in the library UTIL.NEW.

 And/Or, if necessary, complete the skeletal routines STRUCT
 and TRANFR.  (You may find useful routines in UTIL.NEW).
 If you are adding subroutine calls to SUBROUTINE STRUCT or
 SUBROUTINE TRANFR, store the subroutines themselves in
 the libraries called ADDCODEn.NEW, n = 1,2,3,...5. (Please
 list one of the ADDCODEn.NEW libraries for instructions.)

 After you have done all this,  give the command GENPROGRAMS.
 GENPROGRAMS will generate the absolute elements needed to
 optimize whatever you have chosen as your objective (see
 OBJECT routine in BEHAVIOR.NEW) in the presence of whatever
 behavior or other factors (e.g. clearance) are quantified by
 user-written subroutines collected in the libraries
 ADDCODEn.NEW  and/or algorithms added to the skeletal
 routines in the library BEHAVIOR.NEW .


 If an error occurs during GENPROGRAMS, check your FORTRAN
 coding. If you have to change something and rerun, make sure
 to save the old version under a different file name so that
 you can efficiently delete all outdated files with names
 *.NEW without losing a lot of good coding! The writer had
 fallen more than once into that trap during development of
 GENOPT.

 If GENPROGRAMS runs without bombing, try test examples within
 the class of problems covered by your FORTRAN contributions
 to GENOPT before assigning specific design development tasks
 to individuals who may be more naive in the field covered by
 your FORTRAN contributions to GENOPT than you are!

 Please see the cases under genopt/case for examples and more
 information.

 USING GENOPT IN GENERAL AND WITH BIGBOSOR4

 Please read the file, ..genopt/doc/getting.started.
 Please also read the files:
 ...genopt/case/cylinder/howto.bosdec
 ...genopt/case/cylinder/howto.struct
 ...genopt/case/cylinder/howto.behavior
 ...genopt/case/torisph/howto.stags.pdf
 ...genopt/case/torisph/readme.equivellipse
 ...genopt/case/wavycyl/readme.wavycyl

 The main things you must do are the following:

 1. create a file called ..bosdec/sources/bosdec.src, the
 purpose of which is to create a BOSOR4 input file, *.ALL .
 in which "*" represents the users name for the specific case.
 The file, ..genopt/case/torisph/bosdec.equivellipse is a good
 example. Make sure to save bosdec.src by copying it into
 another file. Example: cp bosdec.src bosdec.equivellipse

 2. Flesh out either or both the libraries, struct.new and/or
 behavior.new. In the case, ..genopt/case/torisph, only the
 library struct.new is fleshed out. The library behavior.new is
 not changed from that created automatically by GENOPT. In the
 case, genopt/case/cylinder, both struct.new and behavior.new
 are changed, struct.new in minor ways and behavior.new in
 major ways. Make sure to save struct.new and behavior.new. For
 example: cp struct.new   struct.cylinder
          cp behavior.new behavior.cylinder
 (You save copies of bosdec.src, struct.new, behavior.new
  because it usually takes quite a bit of effort to modify
  the versions automatically created by GENOPT in order to
  solve your generic class of problems.)
 See the following files for examples of modified libraries:


 genopt/case/torisph/struct.tori    (behavior.new not modified)
 genopt/case/torisph/struct.ellipse (behavior.new not modified)
 genopt/case/torisph/struct.equivellipse
                                    (behavior.new not modified)
 genopt/case/cylinder/struct.cylinder
 genopt/case/cylinder/behavior.cylinder
 genopt/case/wavycyl/struct.wavycyl
 genopt/case/wavycyl/behavior.wavycyl
 genopt/case/plate/behavior.plate  (struct.new is not modified)
 genopt/case/plate/behavior.plate  (struct.new is not modified)
 genopt/case/sphere/behavior.plate (struct.new is not modified)
 genopt/case/weldland/behavior.weldland  (tiny mod. struct.new)
 genopt/case/trusscomp/behavior.trusscomp (tiny mod.struct.new)
 genopt/case/submarine/behavior.submarine (tiny mod.struct.new)
 genopt/case/span/behavior.span (tiny modification, struct.new)
 genopt/case/balloon/behavior.balloon (tiny mod. of struct.new)

 The "tiny modification" of struct.new consists of adding only
 three lines to struct.new: CALL OPNGEN, CALL RWDGEN, and
 CALL CLSGEN, added as described on p. 2 of Table 8 of the file
 ...genopt/case/trusscomp/trusscomp.vol1.pdf (see p. 53 of that
 file). The three added statements, CALL OPNGEN, CALL RWDGEN,
 and CALL CLSGEN, open, rewind, and close various files used by
 BIGBOSOR4. If you plan to optimize some other shell using
 GENOPT/BIGBOSOR4 you can "flesh out" struct.new in exactly the
 same way. To find the places in the "skeletal" version of
 struct.new that is automatically produced by GENTEXT, search
 for the string, "YOU MAY WANT" in order to find where you
 should insert the two lines, CALL OPNGEN and CALL RWDGEN.
 Search for the string, "NCONSX", in order to find where you
 should insert the line, CALL CLSGEN.

 ************** NOTE ****************** NOTE ******************
 MAKE SURE ALWAYS TO SAVE COPIES OF struct.new AND behavior.new
 THAT YOU HAVE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO CREATING.
 THE struct.new AND behavior.new FILES ARE DESTROYED BY
 EXECUTION OF "gentext".
 **************************************************************

 3. Execute the GENOPT script called GENPROGRAMS. This script
 "makes" the processors for the user-named generic case. The
 "makefile" called ..genopt/execute/usermake.linux is used. If
 GENPROGRAMS compiles everything successfully, which is not
 likely on your first try because you probably did a lot of
 FORTRAN coding to create bosdec.src, struct.new, behavior.new,
 GENPROGRAMS will end with a list like the following:

 Here is a list of all your newly created executables:
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 bush bush 72012 Oct  8 15:56 autochange.linux
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 bush bush 139553 Oct  8 15:56 begin.linux
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 bush bush 124383 Oct  8 15:56 change.linux
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 bush bush 201104 Oct  8 15:56 chooseplot.linux
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 bush bush 161231 Oct  8 15:56 decide.linux
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 bush bush 104222 Oct  8 15:56 mainsetup.linux
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 bush bush 16920049 Oct  8 15:56 optimize.linux
 -rwxr-xr-x  1 bush bush 95653 Oct  8 15:56 store.linux

 Next, type the command BEGIN to input data for a new specific case.

 If GENPROGRAMS bombs due to fatal compilation errors, or
 even if GENPROGRAMS seems to finish successfully, it is best
 to inspect the file ..genoptcase/usermakelinux.log. If there
 are compilation errors, revise the appropriate source codes,
 bosdec.src and/or struct.new and/or behavior.new, and execute
 GENPROGRAMS again. Keep doing this until everything is okay.

 4. Next, think up a good name for your specific case and run
 BEGIN, DECIDE, MAINSETUP, and OPTIMISE (several times) or
 SUPEROPT. (See the file ..genopt/doc/getting.started and
 the directories, genopt/case/cylinder and genopt/case/torisph
 for examples.) Even though you had a successful "make" via
 GENPROGRAMS in the previous step, something will doubtless not
 be satisfactory and you will have to or want to make further
 changes to one or more of the source files, bosdec.src,
 struct.new, behavior.new.

 THE NEXT STEPS PERTAIN TO THE USE OF GENOPT WITH BIGBOSOR4

 5. You must have the BIGBOSOR4 software in the directory,
 ..bosdec/sources. You need to have the following files there:
 addbosor4.src, b4util.src, opngen.src, prompter.src, gasp.F,
 gasp_linux.o, bio_linux.c, bio_linux.o, b4plot.src, as well as
 the bosdec.src file discussed above. (See "getting started".)

 6. The "make" file, ..genopt/execute/usermake.linux, must
 include references to the BIGBOSOR4 sofware listed in Step 5.
 Please see the file ..genopt/execute/usermake.linux, which
 already exists. (You do not have to do anything about it!)

 7. Suppose everything compiles correctly during the
 GENPROGRAMS execution, but when you try to run a specific case
 the run bombs. Suppose all of your contributed FORTRAN coding
 is in ..bosdec/sources/bosdec.src and in
       ..genoptcase/struct.new (..genoptcase/behavior.new did
 not need to be modified for your case, as is true for the
 generic case called "equivellipse" in ..genopt/case/torisph).
 It is very helpful to insert a "CALL EXIT" statement after one
 of the analyses performed in struct.new, then to execute
 GENPROGRAMS again to recompile the temporarily changed
 struct.new. The reason for doing this is explained in the file
 ..genopt/case/torisph/struct.equivellipse and also in the file
 ..genopt/doc/getting.started: you want to be able to make a
 BIGBOSOR4 run to be certain that:
 a. ..bosdec/sources/bosdec.src created a valid BOSOR4 input
    file, and,
 b. the BIGBOSOR4 run did not finish for some reason.
