 1. buckling from BIGBOSOR4: BUCKB4, BUCKB4A, BUCKB4F
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 BUCKB4 = buckling load factor computed from BIGBOSOR4
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 NOTE: The "BUCKB4" mode shape may represent

 local buckling or general buckling. In this generic

 to the lowest eigenvalue. The other type of buckling

 (general buckling if the lowest eigenvalue corresponds

 2. loss of prebuckling tension, TENLOS, TENLOSA, TENLOSF,

 3. stresses: STRMi(j,k), STRMiA(j,k), STRMiF(j,k)

 in which "i" is the material number, "j" is the load case

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 STRMi(j,k) is the maximum stress.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 STRMiA(j,k) is the stress allowable
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 STRMiF(j,k) is the stress factor of safety.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 There are five stress components:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 STRMi(j,1) = maximum tensile stress in the meridional direction
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 STRMi(j,2) = maximum compressive stress in the meridional direction
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 STRMi(j,3) = maxiamum tensile stress in the circumfer. direction
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 In the case of the cylindrical balloon, STRMi(j,3) is the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 maximum tensile stress along the axis of the prismatic

 shell, that is, in the circumferential direction of the

 "huge torus" model of the cylindrical shell. The "huge torus"

 model of a cylindrical shell is shown in Fig. 3 of [1a].

 STRMi(j,4) = maximum compressive stress in the circumf.direction

 The same comment applies to STRMi(j,4) as to STRMi(j,3).
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 y         $ Do you want to include a "help" paragraph?
 For this problem, use a value that depends of POUTER.
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 For example, suppose you want to design the balloon for
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 an external pressure, POUTER = 15 psi. Corresponding to
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 POUTER = 15 psi you would use a factor of safety,
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 BUCKB4F = 1.0. However, because of the nonlinearity of
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the pre-buckling equilibrium state of the balloon the
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Newton iterations may fail to converge if you use
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 POUTER = 15 psi. You will probably want to use POUTER = 5
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 psi, or something like that. If you use POUTER = 5 psi,
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 you must correspondingly use a factor of safety of 3.0
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 instead of 1.0. Always maintain the correspondence:
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (design pressure)/POUTER = BUCKB4F
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 This "rule" also applies to the factor of safety
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 Next, you will be asked to supply an allowable and a
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 factor of safety for the load factor, TENLOS, that
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 corresponds to the initial loss of tension in any of the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 segments of the balloon subjected to the total load,

 that is, to PINNER, PMIDDL, DELTAT (if any), and POUTER.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 The allowable should always be 1.0. The factor of safety
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 depends on what you used for POUTER. If POUTER = the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 design pressure,say, POUTER = 15 psi, then you should use
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 a factor of safety, TENLOSF = 1.0. If you use a smaller
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 value of POUTER, say, POUTER = 5 psi, then you must use
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 a correspondingly higher factor of safety, TENLOSF = 3.0

 Next, you will be asked to provide an objective.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 In this case the objective is the weight/(axial length)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of the balloon.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 This definition, "weight/length of the balloon", is
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 appropriate only for the cylindrical balloon. In spite

 the WEIGHT of the spherical balloon. However, in the
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 case of the spherical balloon, the variable, WEIGHT,
