 Usually you should supply the allowable for local buckling

 as 1.0, since the local buckling load is actually a buckling

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 local buckling load = (eigenvalue) x (applied axial compression)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in which (eigenvalue) is the buckling load factor. You can

 supply 1.0 for the local buckling allowable because you will

 be given the opportunity to supply a factor of safety for

 Next, you will be asked to provide an allowable and a
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 factor of safety for a behavior called "CYLBUK". CYLBUK
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 is the buckling load factor for "classical buckling of

 by Warren C. Young and richard G. budynas (7th edition),
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 McGraw-Hill, 2002. This "classical" buckling formula is:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 sigma(critical) = (EMOD*THICK/RADLOC)/SQRT[3(1-NU***2)]
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in which sigma(critical) is the buckling stress and
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 RADLOC is the radius of a corrugation. The buckling load
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 factor is sigma(critical)/sigma(axial), in which
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 sigma(axial) is the applied axial compressive stress.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 An appropriate knockdown factor is applied to the "classical"

 buckling formula. Therefore, you should apply a factor of
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 safety of 1.0 only for this behavioral constraint. CYLBUK
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
