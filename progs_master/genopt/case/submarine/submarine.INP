 This application of GENOPT/BIGBOSOR4 is for an

 externally pressurized tank which has a spherical
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 dome connected to a cylindrical shell. The material is

 elastic. The tank is subjected to uniform external
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 pressure. Design constraints include stress and buckling.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Symmetry conditions are applied at the midlength of the

 cylindrical shell. The objective is minimum weight.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 The main aim of the optimization is to determine the

 best distribution of the material in the neighborhood
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of the junction between the spherical dome and the

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of the junction between the spherical dome and the

 the junction between dome and cylinder. The INDIC=1

 The buckling eigenvalue is a buckling load factor. The

 load applied to the shell is PRESS, the external pressure.
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 BUCKL is the factor by which PRESS should be multiplied
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in order to get the buckling pressure. For buckling, the
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 allowable, BUCKLA, should ordinarily be set to unity,
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 because you will be asked to provide a factor of safety
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 next. It is the factor of safety that compensates for
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 initial imperfections, not the allowable.

 factor of safety for buckling
 y         $ Do you want to include a "help" paragraph?
 In order to compensate for initial imperfections,
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 use a factor of safety for buckling of between 1.4 and 3.0.
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 If buckling occurs in the spherical dome, then a factor of
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 safety of 3.0 is appropriate. If buckling occurs in the
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 cylindrical shell, then a factor of safety of 1.4 or
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 something like that is appropriate. Unfortunately, in
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 this case the factor of safety depends on which part of
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the tank buckles. For this submarine, which is to operate
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 at extreme depths, buckling may well not be critical. It
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 may well be that the stress constraint becomes active
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 whereas the buckling constraint remains inactive. You
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 may have to optimize with one factor of safety, see where

 the optimized tank buckles, then re-optimize using a
