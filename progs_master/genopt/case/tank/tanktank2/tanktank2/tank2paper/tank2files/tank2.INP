 skirts that support the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 propellant tank. The tank is carried by a booster that

 imparts a certain ultimate peak axial acceleration and a
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 domed ends. It is made of isotropic material.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 The three parts of the propellant tank (1. aft dome, 2.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 cylindrical middle, 3. forward dome) have internal orthogrid
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 stiffening that is "smeared out" in all the BIGBOSOR4 models.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 In the BIGBOSOR4 models the smeared orthogrid stiffeners are
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 treated as an orthotropic layer of constant thickness. The
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 tank wall is modeled as consisting of three layers:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Innermost layer: smeared orthogrid of thickness equal to
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the height of the orthogrid stiffeners and stiffness and
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 density equal to the tank wall material "E" & "rho" multiplied
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 by (orthogrid stiffener thickness)/(stiffener spacing)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Middle layer: constant thickness that may differ in each
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of the three parts of the propellant tank
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Outer layer: variable thickness that represents tapered
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 doublers attached to the outer wall of the propellant tank
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 centered on axial locations where supporting skirts are
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 attached to external rings that are part of the tank.

 The BIGBOSOR4 shell wall type, NWALL = 9, is used in order
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to simulate this three-layered construction. NWALL = 9 is
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the BIGBOSOR4 option for a laminated composite wall in
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 which one or more of the layers may have thickness that

 varies along the meridian.

 In the free vibration BIGBOSOR4 model the mass of the fluid

 in the tank is "lumped" into the constant-thickness middle
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 layer of the three-layered orthotropic wall. For the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 cylindrical part of the propellant tank the "effective"
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 wall skin density, rho(add), to be added to the material
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 density is obtained from the relationship:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (cylindrical tank volume)xrho(propellant) =
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (volume occupied by shell wall skin)xrho(add)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 or, for a cylindrical shell:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 pi x r^2 x L x rho(propellant) = 2 x pi x r x L x t x rho(add)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 which leads to rho(add) = 0.5 x r/t x rho(propellant)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 For a spherical dome, we have:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (4/3) x pi x r^3 x rho(propellant) = 4 x pi x r^2 x t x rho(add)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 which leads to rho(add) = 0.333 x r/t x rho(propellant)
