 This is a computer program that uses GENOPT and BIGBOSOR4
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to find the optimum arrangement of struts and the optimum
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 design of struts within that arrangement that support the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 propellant tank. The tank is carried by a booster that
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 imparts a certain ultimate peak axial acceleration and a
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 certain ultimate peak lateral acceleration. The minimum free
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 vibration frequency must be greater than some specified
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 value. The tank is assumed to be either cylindrical with
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 domed ends or spherical. It is made of isotropic material.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 It may have locally thickened regions and stiffening rings
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to handle the concentrated loads applied by the struts.

 The three parts of the propellant tank (1. aft dome, 2.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 cylindrical middle, 3. forward dome) have internal orthogrid
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 stiffening that is "smeared out" in all the BIGBOSOR4 models.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 In the BIGBOSOR4 models the smeared orthogrid stiffeners are
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 treated as an orthotropic layer of constant thickness. The
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 tank wall is modeled as consisting of three layers:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Innermost layer: smeared orthogrid of thickness equal to
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the height of the orthogrid stiffeners and stiffness and
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 density equal to the tank wall material "E" & "rho" multiplied
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 by (orthogrid stiffener thickness)/(stiffener spacing)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Middle layer: constant thickness that may differ in each
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of the three parts of the propellant tank
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Outer layer: variable thickness that represents tapered
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 doublers attached to the outer wall of the propellant tank
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 centered on axial locations where supporting struts are
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 attached to external rings that are part of the tank.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 The BIGBOSOR4 shell wall type, NWALL = 9, is used in order
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to simulate this three-layered construction. NWALL = 9 is
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the BIGBOSOR4 option for a layered orthotropic wall in
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 which one or more of the layers may have thickness that
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 varies along the meridian.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 In the free vibration BIGBOSOR4 model the mass of the fluid
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in the tank is "lumped" into the constant-thickness middle
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 layer of the three-layered orthotropic wall. For the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 cylindrical part of the propellant tank the "effective"
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 wall skin density, rho(add), to be added to the material
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 density is obtained from the relationship:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (cylindrical tank volume)xrho(propellant) =
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (volume occupied by shell wall skin)xrho(add)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 or, for a cylindrical shell:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 pi x r^2 x L x rho(propellant) = 2 x pi x r x L x t x rho(add)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 which leads to rho(add) = 0.5 x r/t x rho(propellant)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 For a spherical dome, we have:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (4/3) x pi x r^3 x rho(propellant) = 4 x pi x r^2 x t x rho(add)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 which leads to rho(add) = 0.333 x r/t x rho(propellant)
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 There may be struts attached to the tank at a number of axial
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 locations. At each of these axial locations there are n sets
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of two struts each. In each pair of two struts, one strut has a
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 positive azimuthal angle and the other strut has an equal
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 negative azimuthal angle. These positive and negative azimuthal
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 angles are the same for each of the n sets of struts at that
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 particular axial coordinate of the tank wall.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 All the struts at a given axial coordinate are attached
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to the same external ring, which is part of the propellant
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 tank. All the struts at a given axial coordinate are
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 attached to "ground" (the launch vehicle, assumed to be
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 rigid in this model) at the same (different) axial coordinate.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Therefore, all the struts at the given "ground" axial
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 coordinate have the same inclination or declination angle.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 There may be different numbers of strut pairs at different
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 axial locations. The plus and minus azimuthal angles and
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 inclination or declination angles in each group of struts,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 that is, at each axial location may differ.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 For each strut at a given axial location one end of the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 strut is attached to the propellant tank and the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 other end of the strut is connected to "ground", in which
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 "ground" means the (rigid) launch vehicle that carries the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 propellant tank. There is no launch vehicle model in this
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 study.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 To summarize:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 1. There may be up to 3 axial locations at which structs
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 are attached to the propellant tank and to ground.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 2. At each axial location all the attachment points of the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 struts to the tank have the same axial coordinate; the struts
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 are attached to the propellant tank along a ring.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 3. The other ends of these struts are attached to "ground"
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 at the same axial location (in general different from the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 axial location of the tank-end of these struts).
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 4. There are n(i) strut pairs at each axial location
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in which i corresponds to a particular axial location.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 n(1), n(2), n(3)... may differ from eachother.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 In that paper the quantity n = 3, that is, there are

 three strut pairs at each of one or two axial locations.
