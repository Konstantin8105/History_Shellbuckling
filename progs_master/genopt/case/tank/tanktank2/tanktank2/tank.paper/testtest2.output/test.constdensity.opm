 CHAPTER 1 (BEHX01x, x = 1,2,...; x=load case):
 Find the lengths of struts and the axial loads in the
 struts from a BIGBOSOR4 model of the propellant tank
 supported by springs with an arbitrarily assigned spring
 constant. The flexibility of the propellant tank is
 neglected, the strut end fittings are neglected, and the
 propellant tank is loaded by ullage pressure, PRESS, tank
 cool-down, TNKCOOL, axial acceleration, GAXIAL, and lateral
 acceleration, GLATRL. This is a first approximation.
 The BIGBOSOR4 model is stored in *.BEHX01x, x = 1, 2...,
 in which "x" represents the load case.

 CHAPTER 2:
 Optain PostScript plot files, *.PL6.ps, *.PL7.ps, *.PL8.ps,
 which contain a plan view of the AFT set of struts (*.PL6.ps),
 a plan view of the FORWARD set of struts (*.PL7.ps, if any),
 and an elevation view of both AFT and FORWARD sets of struts
 (*.PL8.ps). The FORTRAN software is "borrowed" from the
 "DEWAR" system (SUBROUTINE STPLOT and the subroutines called
 by STPLOT). These FORTRAN subroutines are part of the
 bosdec.tank library.

 CHAPTER 3 (BEHX02x, x=1,2,...; x=load case):
 1. Fill the "DEWAR" labelled common blocks with the
 proper quantities so that buckling load factors of
 the strut launch tubes (buckling as thin shells) and
 so that the 5 stress components in composite laminate
 plies can be determined from "PANDA-type" of analyses
 similar to those analyses that are used in the "DEWAR"
 system for buckling and stress of the strut launch tubes.

 2. Compute from SUBROUTINE GETCIJ the 6 x 6 constitutive
 stiffness matrix for each type of strut tube. SUBROUTINE
 GETCIJ is very like a subroutine of the same name in PANDA2.
  
 3. Find the axial stiffnesses of aft and forward strut
 tubes. These strut tube stiffnesses are to be used in the
 computation of spring constants associated with each strut
 in the AFT set of struts and associated with each strut in
 the FORWARD set of struts (if any). In the "DO 20" loop of
 SUBROUTINE STRUCT, I = 1 corresponds to the AFT set of struts
 and I = 2 corresponds to the FORWARD set of struts.

 CHAPTER 4 (BEHX03x, x = 1,2,...; x=load case):
 Compute the linear static response of the propellant tank
 to concentrated loads applied by the struts (springs) to
 the tank along the tank support ring no. 1 (aft strut set)
 and along the tank support ring no. 2 (forward strut set).
 In this BIGBSOSOR4 model of the propellant tank the springs
 (struts) are replaced by concentrated loads obtained from
 the CHAPTER 1 computations. The concentrated loads are modeled
 in BIGBOSOR4 as line loads with little triangular "pulses"
 centered about the circumferential angles where the struts
 are pinned to the propellant tank and at the global axial
 coordinates that corresponds to the global axial coordinates
 of the centroids of the aft and forward propellant tank
 support rings. The circumferential distributions of the line
 loads are expanded in Fourier series, and the static response
 to each Fourier component is superposed by BIGBOSOR4 in what
 is called in BIGBOSOR4 jargon an "INDIC=3" type of analysis.
 Sixty Fourier terms are used in the Fourier series expansion.

 The purpose of this calculation is to find the maximum
 displacement of the propellant tank wall in the same direction
 as the axis of one of the struts: 1. the strut associated with
 the greatest tank wall displacement produced by the AFT strut
 set and 2. the strut associated with the greatest tank wall
 displacement produced by the FORWARD strut set. These two
 maximum local tank wall displacements are used in the
 determination of the spring constants to be associated with
 each of the AFT struts and with each of the FORWARD struts in
 the models in which the flexibility of the propellant tank is
 accounted for in the computation of the behavior(e.g.vibration)

 In this BIGBOSOR4 model there exist "fake" springs, that is,
 springs with zero axial stiffness. These "fake" springs have
 no influence on the behavior.

 CHAPTER 5 (BEHX04x, x = 1, 2,...; x = load case):
 Repeat the CHAPTER 1 type of computations with the new
 (significantly smaller) spring constants that now account
 for the flexibility of the propellant tank. The purpose of
 this computation is to determine more accurate values of the
 loads in each strut (spring) caused by the loads, PRESS,
 GAXIAL, GLATRL, and TNKCOOL. The updated strut loads are
 used in the following computations:
 1. Buckling of the most highly compressed strut of each type
 (type 1 = "AFT"; type 2 = "FORWARD") as a column (BEHX5) and
 as a shell (BEHX6).
 2. Maximum of each of five stress components in each type
 of strut (BEHX2 for AFT struts and BEHX3 for FORWARD struts).
 3. Maximum stress in the propellant tank due to loading by
 the AFT and FORWARD sets of struts and by the loads, PRESS,
 GAXIAL, GLATRL, and TNKCOOL (BEHX8).
 4. Minimum buckling of the propellant tank under the AFT and
 FORWARD sets of struts and by the loads, PRESS, GAXIAL,
 GLATRL, and TNKCOOL (BEHX9).

 This is a BIGBOSOR4 model of the propellant tank with springs
 (pinned struts) attached. There is no loading. The mass of the
 propellant is "lumped" into the middle wall of the three-
 layered wall (inner layer = smeared orthogrid; middle layer=
 propellant tank wall of constant thickness; outer layer=
 tapered doubler centered on the global axial coordinate where
 each set of struts (AFT and FORWARD) are pinned to the tank.
 The strut (spring) stiffness takes into account the
 flexibility of the propellant tank wall.

 CHAPTER 7: strut stress analysis-BEHX2x, x=1,2; x=load case)
 This is the stress analysis from both BIGBOSOR4 and from
 a PANDA2-type of laminate analysis of the most highly loaded
 strut of the AFT set of struts (struts of type 1). The struts
 are tubes made of composite laminate. The most highly loaded
 strut under both axial tension and equal axial compression is
 analyzed. The tensile/compressive load to which the most
 highly loaded strut is subjected is derived in the computation
 under CHAPTER 5. The five stress "behavioral" constraints
 computed here correspond to:
 1. tension along the fibers of a ply,
 2. compression along the fibers of a ply,
 3. tension transverse to the fibers of a ply,
 4. compression transverse to the fibers of a ply,
 5. in-plane shear stress in a ply.
 Recorded as 5 behavioral constraints are the maximum values
 of each of the five components just listed from tension or
 compression and from a BIGBOSOR4 or a PANDA2-type of model.
 In other words, only the worst (highest) stress component from
 four computations (tension BIGBOSOR4,compression BIGBOSOR4,
 tension PANDA2, compression PANDA2) is recorded as each
 component behavioral constraint.

 CHAPTER 8: strut stress analysis-BEHX3x, x=1,2; x=load case)
 This is the stress analysis from both BIGBOSOR4 and from
 a PANDA2-type of laminate analysis of the most highly loaded
 strut of the FWD set of struts (struts of type 2). The struts
 are tubes made of composite laminate. The most highly loaded
 strut under both axial tension and equal axial compression is
 analyzed. The tensile/compressive load to which the most
 highly loaded strut is subjected is derived in the computation
 under CHAPTER 5. The five stress "behavioral" constraints
 computed here correspond to:
 1. tension along the fibers of a ply,
 2. compression along the fibers of a ply,
 3. tension transverse to the fibers of a ply,
 4. compression transverse to the fibers of a ply,
 5. in-plane shear stress in a ply.
 Recorded as 5 behavioral constraints are the maximum values
 of each of the five components just listed from tension or
 compression and from a BIGBOSOR4 or a PANDA2-type of model.
 In other words, only the worst (highest) stress component from
 four computations (tension BIGBOSOR4,compression BIGBOSOR4,
 tension PANDA2, compression PANDA2) is recorded as each
 component behavioral constraint.

 CHAPTER 9: Buckling of strut as a column
 -BEHX5xy, x=1,2 x=strut type; y=1,2 y=load case
 Only the most highly axially compressed strut in the strut
 set "x" is included in the analysis. Two models are used:
 1. a BIGBOSOR4 model of the strut. n = 1 circumferential wave
    corresponds to buckling of the strut as a column. The
    effect of propellant tank flexibility is NOT included in
    this BIGBOSOR4 model.
 2. an Euler buckling model of the strut. This model is
    analogous to the column buckling model used in "DEWAR".
    The effect of propellant tank flexibility IS included.
 The Euler buckling model usually gives the lower buckling
 load factor, mainly because of propellant tank flexibility.
 The buckling constraint is based on the minimum column
 buckling load factor obtained from the two models just listed.

 CHAPTER 10: Buckling of strut as a shell
 -BEHX6xy, x=1,2 x=strut type; y=1,2 y=load case
 Only the most highly axially compressed strut in the strut
 set "x" is included in the analysis. Two models are used:
 1. a BIGBOSOR4 model of a sub-length of the strut. A search
    is conducted over the number n of circumferential waves in
    the buckling mode to determine the critical buckling load
    factor. The effect of propellant tank flexibility is not
    relevant in this analysis.
 2. a PANDA2-type buckling model of the strut. This model is
    analogous to the shell buckling model used in "DEWAR".
    The effect of propellant tank flexibility is not relevant.

 The PANDA2-type buckling model usually gives the lower
 buckling load factor, mainly because of the effect of
 transverse shear deformation (t.s.d.) and the effect of the
 anisotropic terms, D16 and D26, that BIGBOSOR4 cannot handle.
 The buckling constraint is based on the minimum shell
 buckling load factor obtained from the two models just listed.

 CHAPTER 11: Launch-hold force in a strut
 -BEHX7x, x=1,2; x=load case
 If the propellant tank is oriented vertically in the launch
 vehicle all the struts in each strut set experience the same
 launch-hold force. The launch-hold force in the AFT struts
 may differ from that in the FORWARD struts. Behavioral
 constraints are computed for each set of struts. The
 behavioral constraint is called "FORCE(i,j)", in which i =
 the load case number and j =the strut set number (strut type).

 FORCE(i,j) is computed from a BIGBOSOR4 model of the
 propellant tank with struts (springs) attached to it. The
 spring constants include the effect of the flexibility of the
 propellant tank. The tank is loaded by PRESS, GAXIAL=1g, and
 TNKCOOL. The maximum allowable strut launch-hold force is
 provided for each load case by the End user. The behavioral
 constraint, FORCE(i,j), must be less than the maximum
 allowable, FORCEA(i,j). The End user must supply FORCEA(i,j)
 at a small enough value so that if the struts contain a
 disconnect feature they will not "short out" during the
 launch-hold phase of a mission.

 CHAPTER 12: Maximum effective stress in the isotropic
 propellant tank - BEHX8xy, x=1,2 x=meridian; y=1,2 y=load case
 This is a BIGBOSOR4 model in which the springs (struts) are
 replaced by concentrated loads. The model is analogous to that
 described in CHAPTER 4 (*.BEHX03x, x=1,2; x=load case).
 The propellant tank is loaded by PRESS, GAXIAL, GLATRL, and
 TNKCOOL. The modeling of the concentrated loads that replace
 the springs (struts) is described in CHAPTER 4. The purpose
 of this model is to compute the maximum effective stress in
 the propellant tank, which is assumed to be fabricated of
 isotropic material. This is an "INDIC=3" BIGBOSOR4 model.

 CHAPTER 13: Buckling of the isotropic propellant tank
 - BEHX9xy, x=1,2 x=meridian; y=1,2 y=load case
 This is a BIGBOSOR4 model in which the springs (struts) are
 replaced by concentrated loads. The model is analogous to that
 described in CHAPTER 12 (*.BEHX8xy) except that in this case
 we are interested in buckling rather than maximum stress.
 The propellant tank is loaded by PRESS, GAXIAL, GLATRL, and
 TNKCOOL. The modeling of the concentrated loads that replace
 the springs (struts) is described in CHAPTER 4. The purpose
 of this model is to compute the minimum buckling load of
 the propellant tank, which is assumed to be fabricated of
 isotropic material. This is an "INDIC=4" BIGBOSOR4 model.

 CHAPTER 14: Computation of the objective:
 In general the objective has the form:

 objective =
       WGT*(normalized weight of empty tank)
 +(1.-WGT)*(normalized total strut conductance)
  
 in which (normalized weight of empty tank) =    TOTMAS/TNKNRM
 and      (normalized total strut conductance) = CONDCT/CONNRM
 and WGT, TNKNRM, CONNRM are input variables provided by the
 End user during his/her interactive "BEGIN" session (*.BEG).
  
 If WGT = 0, then the objective is simply the total strut
 conductance, CONDCT. Note that the listed definition of the
 objective is always "total conductance into the tank: CONDCT".

 CHAPTER 1 (BEHX01x, x = 1,2,...; x=load case):
 Find the lengths of struts and the axial loads in the
 struts from a BIGBOSOR4 model of the propellant tank
 supported by springs with an arbitrarily assigned spring
 constant. The flexibility of the propellant tank is
 neglected, the strut end fittings are neglected, and the
 propellant tank is loaded by ullage pressure, PRESS, tank
 cool-down, TNKCOOL, axial acceleration, GAXIAL, and lateral
 acceleration, GLATRL. This is a first approximation.
 The BIGBOSOR4 model is stored in *.BEHX01x, x = 1, 2...,
 in which "x" represents the load case.

 CHAPTER 2:
 Optain PostScript plot files, *.PL6.ps, *.PL7.ps, *.PL8.ps,
 which contain a plan view of the AFT set of struts (*.PL6.ps),
 a plan view of the FORWARD set of struts (*.PL7.ps, if any),
 and an elevation view of both AFT and FORWARD sets of struts
 (*.PL8.ps). The FORTRAN software is "borrowed" from the
 "DEWAR" system (SUBROUTINE STPLOT and the subroutines called
 by STPLOT). These FORTRAN subroutines are part of the
 bosdec.tank library.

 CHAPTER 3 (BEHX02x, x=1,2,...; x=load case):
 1. Fill the "DEWAR" labelled common blocks with the
 proper quantities so that buckling load factors of
 the strut launch tubes (buckling as thin shells) and
 so that the 5 stress components in composite laminate
 plies can be determined from "PANDA-type" of analyses
 similar to those analyses that are used in the "DEWAR"
 system for buckling and stress of the strut launch tubes.

 2. Compute from SUBROUTINE GETCIJ the 6 x 6 constitutive
 stiffness matrix for each type of strut tube. SUBROUTINE
 GETCIJ is very like a subroutine of the same name in PANDA2.
  
 3. Find the axial stiffnesses of aft and forward strut
 tubes. These strut tube stiffnesses are to be used in the
 computation of spring constants associated with each strut
 in the AFT set of struts and associated with each strut in
 the FORWARD set of struts (if any). In the "DO 20" loop of
 SUBROUTINE STRUCT, I = 1 corresponds to the AFT set of struts
 and I = 2 corresponds to the FORWARD set of struts.

 CHAPTER 4 (BEHX03x, x = 1,2,...; x=load case):
 Compute the linear static response of the propellant tank
 to concentrated loads applied by the struts (springs) to
 the tank along the tank support ring no. 1 (aft strut set)
 and along the tank support ring no. 2 (forward strut set).
 In this BIGBSOSOR4 model of the propellant tank the springs
 (struts) are replaced by concentrated loads obtained from
 the CHAPTER 1 computations. The concentrated loads are modeled
 in BIGBOSOR4 as line loads with little triangular "pulses"
 centered about the circumferential angles where the struts
 are pinned to the propellant tank and at the global axial
 coordinates that corresponds to the global axial coordinates
 of the centroids of the aft and forward propellant tank
 support rings. The circumferential distributions of the line
 loads are expanded in Fourier series, and the static response
 to each Fourier component is superposed by BIGBOSOR4 in what
 is called in BIGBOSOR4 jargon an "INDIC=3" type of analysis.
 Sixty Fourier terms are used in the Fourier series expansion.

 The purpose of this calculation is to find the maximum
 displacement of the propellant tank wall in the same direction
 as the axis of one of the struts: 1. the strut associated with
 the greatest tank wall displacement produced by the AFT strut
 set and 2. the strut associated with the greatest tank wall
 displacement produced by the FORWARD strut set. These two
 maximum local tank wall displacements are used in the
 determination of the spring constants to be associated with
 each of the AFT struts and with each of the FORWARD struts in
 the models in which the flexibility of the propellant tank is
 accounted for in the computation of the behavior(e.g.vibration)

 In this BIGBOSOR4 model there exist "fake" springs, that is,
 springs with zero axial stiffness. These "fake" springs have
 no influence on the behavior.

 CHAPTER 5 (BEHX04x, x = 1, 2,...; x = load case):
 Repeat the CHAPTER 1 type of computations with the new
 (significantly smaller) spring constants that now account
 for the flexibility of the propellant tank. The purpose of
 this computation is to determine more accurate values of the
 loads in each strut (spring) caused by the loads, PRESS,
 GAXIAL, GLATRL, and TNKCOOL. The updated strut loads are
 used in the following computations:
 1. Buckling of the most highly compressed strut of each type
 (type 1 = "AFT"; type 2 = "FORWARD") as a column (BEHX5) and
 as a shell (BEHX6).
 2. Maximum of each of five stress components in each type
 of strut (BEHX2 for AFT struts and BEHX3 for FORWARD struts).
 3. Maximum stress in the propellant tank due to loading by
 the AFT and FORWARD sets of struts and by the loads, PRESS,
 GAXIAL, GLATRL, and TNKCOOL (BEHX8).
 4. Minimum buckling of the propellant tank under the AFT and
 FORWARD sets of struts and by the loads, PRESS, GAXIAL,
 GLATRL, and TNKCOOL (BEHX9).

 This is a BIGBOSOR4 model of the propellant tank with springs
 (pinned struts) attached. There is no loading. The mass of the
 propellant is "lumped" into the middle wall of the three-
 layered wall (inner layer = smeared orthogrid; middle layer=
 propellant tank wall of constant thickness; outer layer=
 tapered doubler centered on the global axial coordinate where
 each set of struts (AFT and FORWARD) are pinned to the tank.
 The strut (spring) stiffness takes into account the
 flexibility of the propellant tank wall.

 This is the stress analysis from both BIGBOSOR4 and from
 a PANDA2-type of laminate analysis of the most highly loaded
 strut of the AFT set of struts (struts of type 1). The struts
 are tubes made of composite laminate. The most highly loaded
 strut under both axial tension and equal axial compression is
 analyzed. The tensile/compressive load to which the most
 highly loaded strut is subjected is derived in the computation
 under CHAPTER 5. The five stress "behavioral" constraints
 computed here correspond to:
 1. tension along the fibers of a ply,
 2. compression along the fibers of a ply,
 3. tension transverse to the fibers of a ply,
 4. compression transverse to the fibers of a ply,
 5. in-plane shear stress in a ply.
 Recorded as 5 behavioral constraints are the maximum values
 of each of the five components just listed from tension or
 compression and from a BIGBOSOR4 or a PANDA2-type of model.
 In other words, only the worst (highest) stress component from
 four computations (tension BIGBOSOR4,compression BIGBOSOR4,
 tension PANDA2, compression PANDA2) is recorded as each
 component behavioral constraint.

 CHAPTER 9: Buckling of strut as a column
 -BEHX5xy, x=1,2 x=strut type; y=1,2 y=load case
 Only the most highly axially compressed strut in the strut
 set "x" is included in the analysis. Two models are used:
 1. a BIGBOSOR4 model of the strut. n = 1 circumferential wave
    corresponds to buckling of the strut as a column. The
    effect of propellant tank flexibility is NOT included in
    this BIGBOSOR4 model.
 2. an Euler buckling model of the strut. This model is
    analogous to the column buckling model used in "DEWAR".
    The effect of propellant tank flexibility IS included.
 The Euler buckling model usually gives the lower buckling
 load factor, mainly because of propellant tank flexibility.
 The buckling constraint is based on the minimum column
 buckling load factor obtained from the two models just listed.

 CHAPTER 10: Buckling of strut as a shell
 -BEHX6xy, x=1,2 x=strut type; y=1,2 y=load case
 Only the most highly axially compressed strut in the strut
 set "x" is included in the analysis. Two models are used:
 1. a BIGBOSOR4 model of a sub-length of the strut. A search
    is conducted over the number n of circumferential waves in
    the buckling mode to determine the critical buckling load
    factor. The effect of propellant tank flexibility is not
    relevant in this analysis.
 2. a PANDA2-type buckling model of the strut. This model is
    analogous to the shell buckling model used in "DEWAR".
    The effect of propellant tank flexibility is not relevant.

 The PANDA2-type buckling model usually gives the lower
 buckling load factor, mainly because of the effect of
 transverse shear deformation (t.s.d.) and the effect of the
 anisotropic terms, D16 and D26, that BIGBOSOR4 cannot handle.
 The buckling constraint is based on the minimum shell
 buckling load factor obtained from the two models just listed.

 CHAPTER 11: Launch-hold force in a strut
 -BEHX7x, x=1,2; x=load case
 If the propellant tank is oriented vertically in the launch
 vehicle all the struts in each strut set experience the same
 launch-hold force. The launch-hold force in the AFT struts
 may differ from that in the FORWARD struts. Behavioral
 constraints are computed for each set of struts. The
 behavioral constraint is called "FORCE(i,j)", in which i =
 the load case number and j =the strut set number (strut type).

 FORCE(i,j) is computed from a BIGBOSOR4 model of the
 propellant tank with struts (springs) attached to it. The
 spring constants include the effect of the flexibility of the
 propellant tank. The tank is loaded by PRESS, GAXIAL=1g, and
 TNKCOOL. The maximum allowable strut launch-hold force is
 provided for each load case by the End user. The behavioral
 constraint, FORCE(i,j), must be less than the maximum
 allowable, FORCEA(i,j). The End user must supply FORCEA(i,j)
 at a small enough value so that if the struts contain a
 disconnect feature they will not "short out" during the
 launch-hold phase of a mission.

 CHAPTER 12: Maximum effective stress in the isotropic
 propellant tank - BEHX8xy, x=1,2 x=meridian; y=1,2 y=load case
 This is a BIGBOSOR4 model in which the springs (struts) are
 replaced by concentrated loads. The model is analogous to that
 described in CHAPTER 4 (*.BEHX03x, x=1,2; x=load case).
 The propellant tank is loaded by PRESS, GAXIAL, GLATRL, and
 TNKCOOL. The modeling of the concentrated loads that replace
 the springs (struts) is described in CHAPTER 4. The purpose
 of this model is to compute the maximum effective stress in
 the propellant tank, which is assumed to be fabricated of
 isotropic material. This is an "INDIC=3" BIGBOSOR4 model.

 CHAPTER 13: Buckling of the isotropic propellant tank
 - BEHX9xy, x=1,2 x=meridian; y=1,2 y=load case
 This is a BIGBOSOR4 model in which the springs (struts) are
 replaced by concentrated loads. The model is analogous to that
 described in CHAPTER 12 (*.BEHX8xy) except that in this case
 we are interested in buckling rather than maximum stress.
 The propellant tank is loaded by PRESS, GAXIAL, GLATRL, and
 TNKCOOL. The modeling of the concentrated loads that replace
 the springs (struts) is described in CHAPTER 4. The purpose
 of this model is to compute the minimum buckling load of
 the propellant tank, which is assumed to be fabricated of
 isotropic material. This is an "INDIC=4" BIGBOSOR4 model.

 DESCRIPTION OF FILES USED AND GENERATED IN THIS RUN:

 test.NAM = This file contains only the name of the case.
 test.OPM = Output data. Please list this file and inspect
            carefully before proceeding.
 test.OPP = Output file containing evolution of design and
            margins since the beginning of optimization cycles.
 test.CBL = Labelled common blocks for analysis.
            (This is an unformatted sequential file.)
 test.OPT = This file contains the input data for MAINSETUP
             as well as OPTIMIZE. The batch command OPTIMIZE
             can be given over and over again without having
             to return to MAINSETUP because test.OPT exists.
 URPROMPT.DAT= Prompt file for interactive input.

 For further information about files used and generated
 during operation of GENOPT, give the command HELPG FILES.

 Menu of commands: CHOOSEPLOT, OPTIMIZE, MAINSETUP, CHANGE,
                   DECIDE, SUPEROPT 

 IN ORDER TO AVOID FALSE CONVERGENCE OF THE DESIGN, BE SURE TO
 RUN  "OPTIMIZE"  MANY TIMES DURING AN OPTIMIZATION AND/OR USE
 THE "GLOBAL" OPTIMIZING SCRIPT, "SUPEROPT".
 **** NOTE: It is almost always best to set the number of ****
 **** iterations per execution of "OPTIMIZE" equal to 5   ****
 **** in response to the following prompt in "MAINSETUP": ****
 **** "How many design iterations in this run (3 to 25)?" ****
 **** Hence, the *.OPT file should almost always have the ****
 **** following line in it:                               ****
 **** "5   $ How many design iterations in this run (3 to 25)?"
