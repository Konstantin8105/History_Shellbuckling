   TABLE 5: CONTENTS OF SMALL FILES CREATED BY   "GENTEXT"
 ============================================================
   FILE NAME                DEFINITION OF FILE CONTENTS
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 tank.PRO             Prompts and help paragraphs for interactive
                          input to the user-developed optimization code.

 tank.NEW             Part of BEGIN.NEW that contains calls to
                          SUBROUTINE DATUM and SUBROUTINE GETVAR.
                          This coding sets up the interactive input
                          for the starting design in the user-generated
                          design code.

 tank.INP             Image of interactive input for user-developed
                          program, generated to save time in case you make
                          a mistake during input.

 tank.COM             Labelled common blocks generated specifically
                          for the user-developed class of problems.

 tank.WRI             Part of subroutine for writing labelled common
                          blocks in SUBROUTINE STORCM (in Library STOGET).

 tank.REA             Part of subroutine for reading labelled common
                          blocks in SUBROUTINE GETCOM (in Library STOGET).

 tank.SET             Part of SUBROUTINE SETUPC in which new values
                          are installed in labelled common blocks from
                          the array VAR(I), which contains the latest
                          values of all candidates for decision variables.

 tank.CON             Calls to subroutines, BEHX1, BEHX2, BEHX3,...,
                          which calculate behavior such as stresses
                          modal frequencies, buckling loads, etc.
                          Also, calls to CON, which generate the value
                          of the behavioral constraints corresponding
                          to BEHX1, BEHX2, BEHX3,...
                          Also, generates phrases that identify, in the
                          output of the user-generated program, the
                          exact meaning of each behavioral constraint.

 tank.SUB             Skeletal subroutines, BEHX1, BEHX2, ..., and the
                          skeletal objective function, OBJECT.

 tank.DEF             List of user-established variable names,
                          definitions, and roles that these variables play
                          in the user-generated program.  Also, contains
                          list of files created by GENTEXT and the
                          functions of these files.

 tank.CHA             Part of SUBROUTINE NEWPAR (called in the CHANGE
                          processor) in which labelled common values are
                          updated.

 tank.DAT             Image of interactive input for user-developed
                          program, generated to save time in case you make
                          a mistake during input. This file is used by
                          the INSERT processor.
