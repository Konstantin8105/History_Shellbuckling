C YOU ARE USING WHAT I HAVE CALLED "GENOPT" TO GENERATE AN
C OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM FOR A PARTICULAR CLASS OF PROBLEMS.
C THE NAME YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR THIS CLASS OF PROBLEMS IS: tank

C "GENOPT" (GENeral OPTimization) was written during 1987-1988
C by Dr. David Bushnell, Dept. 93-30, Bldg. 315, (415)424-3237
C    Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., 3315 Hanover St.,

C The optimizer used in GENOPT is called ADS, and was
C written by G. Vanderplaats [3]. It is based on the method
C of feasible directions [4].

C                       ABSTRACT

C "GENOPT" has the following purposes and properties:
C     1. Any relatively simple analysis is "automatically"
C        converted into an optimization of whatever system
C        can be analyzed with fixed properties. Please note
C        that GENOPT is not intended to be used for problems
C        that require elaborate data-base management systems
C        or large numbers of degrees of freedom.

C     2. The optimization problems need not be in fields nor
C        jargon familiar to me, the developer of GENOPT.
C        Although all of the example cases (See the cases
C        in the directories under genopt/case)
C        are in the field of structural analysis, GENOPT is
C        not limited to that field.


C     3. GENOPT is a program that writes other programs. These
C        programs, WHEN AUGMENTED BY USER-SUPPLIED CODING,
C        form a program system that should be user-friendly in
C        the GENOPT-user"s field. In this instance the user
C        of GENOPT must later supply FORTRAN coding that
C        calculates behavior in the problem class called "tank".

C     4. Input data and textual material are elicited from
C        the user of GENOPT in a general enough way so that
C        he or she may employ whatever data, definitions, and
C        "help" paragraphs will make subsequent use of the
C        program system thus generated easy by those less
C        familiar with the class of problems "tank" than
C        the GENOPT user.

C     5. The program system generated by GENOPT has the same
C        general architecture as previous programs written for
C        specific applications by the developer [7 - 16]. That
C        is, the command set is:

C           BEGIN     (User supplies starting design, loads,
C                      control integers, material properties,
C                      etc. in an interactive-help mode.)

C           DECIDE    (User chooses decision and linked
C                      variables and inequality constraints
C                      that are not based on behavior.)

C           MAINSETUP (User chooses output option, whether
C                      to perform analysis of a fixed design
C                      or to optimize, and number of design
C                      iterations.)

C           OPTIMIZE  (The program system performs, in a batch
C                      mode, the work specified in MAINSETUP.)

C           SUPEROPT  (Program tries to find the GLOBAL optimum
C                      design as described in Ref.[11] listed
C                      below (Many OPTIMIZEs in one run.)

C           CHANGE    (User changes certain parameters)

C           CHOOSEPLOT (User selects which quantities to plot
C                       vs. design iterations.)

C           DIPLOT    (User generates plots)

C           CLEANSPEC (User cleans out unwanted files.)

C     A typical runstream is:
C       GENOPTLOG   (activate command set)
C       BEGIN       (provide starting design, loads, etc.)
C       DECIDE      (choose decision variables and bounds)
C       MAINSETUP   (choose print option and analysis type)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       CHANGE      (change some variables for new starting pt)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       OPTIMIZE    (launch batch run for n design iterations)
C       CHOOSEPLOT  (choose which variables to plot)
C       DIPLOT      (plot variables v. iterations)
C       CHOOSEPLOT  (choose additional variables to plot)
C       DIPLOT      (plot more variables v design iterations)
C       CLEANSPEC   (delete extraneous files for specific case)

C  IMPORTANT:  YOU MUST ALWAYS GIVE THE COMMAND "OPTIMIZE"
C              SEVERAL TIMES IN SUCCESSION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN
C              CONVERGENCE! AN EXPLANATION OF WHY YOU MUST DO
C              THIS IS GIVEN ON P 580-582 OF THE PAPER "PANDA2,
C              PROGRAM FOR MINIMUM WEIGHT DESIGN OF STIFFENED,
C              COMPOSITE LOCALLY BUCKLED PANELS", Computers and
C              Structures, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp 469-605 (1987).

C Due to introduction of a "global" optimizer, SUPEROPT,
C described in Ref.[11], you can now use the runstream

C      BEGIN       (provide starting design, loads, etc.)
C      DECIDE      (choose decision variables and bounds)
C      MAINSETUP   (choose print option and analysis type)
C      SUPEROPT    (launch batch run for "global" optimization)
C      CHOOSEPLOT  (choose which variables to plot)
C      DIPLOT      (plot variables v. iterations)

C "Global" is in quotes because SUPEROPT does its best to find
C a true global optimum design. The user is strongly urged to
C execute SUPEROPT/CHOOSEPLOT several times in succession in
C order to determine an optimum that is essentially just as
C good as the theoretical true global optimum. Each execution
C of the series,
C      SUPEROPT
C      CHOOSEPLOT

C does the following:

C 1. SUPEROPT executes many sets of the two processors,
C    OPTIMIZE and AUTOCHANGE (AUTOCHANGE gets a new random
C    "starting" design), in which each set does the following:

C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      OPTIMIZE          (perform k design iterations)
C      AUTOCHANGE        (get new starting design randomly)

C    SUPEROPT keeps repeating the above sequence until the
C    total number of design iterations reaches about 270.
C    The number of OPTIMIZEs per AUTOCHANGE is user-provided.

C 2. CHOOSEPLOT allows the user to plot stuff and resets the
C    total number of design iterations from SUPEROPT to zero.
C    After each execution of SUPEROPT the user MUST execute
C    CHOOSEPLOT: before the next execution of SUPEROPT the
C    total number of design iterations MUST be reset to zero.
