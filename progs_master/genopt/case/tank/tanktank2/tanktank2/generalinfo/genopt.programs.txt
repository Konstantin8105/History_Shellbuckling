 TABLE 4   FILE OF PROMPTING PHRASES AND HELPS AND
           SOURCE CODE LIBRARIES GENERATED BY "GENTEXT"
 ==============================================================
  tank.PRO   = prompt file for input data for the problem
                class that you wish to set up for optimization.
                When BEGIN asks you for the name of the generic
                file, you should respond in this case with tank.

                The Prompt Numbers listed in TABLE 2 correspond
                to the prompts in this file.

  BEGIN.NEW   = source library for FORTRAN program which will
                be used to set up the starting design, material
                properties, and any other data you wish.

  STOGET.NEW  = source library for FORTRAN subroutines which
                are used to transfer labelled common blocks.
                These labelled common blocks are the data base.

  STRUCT.NEW  = source library for FORTRAN subroutines that
                perform the analysis for each iterate in the
                set of optimization iterations.  You may have
                to complete this routine (add dimension state-
                ments, subroutine calls, output statements,
                etc.).  The library, STRUCT.NEW, also contains
                a skeletal routine, SUB. TRANFR, that you can
                complete in order to translate data names from
                from those just established by you (TABLE 2) to
                other names used by the developer of previously
                written code that you may plan to incorporate
                into SUBROUTINE STRUCT and/or SUBROUTINES
                BEHX1, BEHX2, BEHX3,...BEHXn (described next).


  BEHAVIOR.NEW= a library of subroutine skeletons, BEHX1,BEHX2,
                BEHX3,...BEHXn, that, upon completion by you,
                will calculate behavior for a given design or
                design perturbation.  Skeletal subroutines for
                a user-written constraint condition, USRCON,
                and a skeletal routine for the objective func-
                tion, OBJECT, are also generated and are
                included in the BEHAVIOR.NEW library.

  CHANGE.NEW  = FORTRAN program that permits you to change
                certain program parameters without having to
                go back to BEGIN and run a case from scratch.
