 This GENOPT case is for a cylindrical shell the wall of
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 which is a truss-core sandwich. Each segment of a truss-
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 core sandwich module may be a composite laminate. Hence,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the name, "trusscomp". The truss-core module used for local
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 buckling consists of 22 shell segments of the type used
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in BIGBOSOR4. Figure 4 shows the segment numbering and
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 direction of travel along each segment. Up to nine 22-segment
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 modules may be chained together to form the model used for
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 local buckling (Figs.23,24). The truss-core sandwich module
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 used for general buckling consists of 6 shell segments. Fig.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 6 (top) shows the segment numbering and direction of travel
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 along each segment. Many 6-segment modules are chained together

 (46 modules) to form the model used for general buckling (Fig.1b).

 General and local buckling load factors are determined

 from BIGBOSOR4. The shell is modeled as a part of a "huge

 torus" (Fig.1a). A membrane prebuckled state is assumed to exist.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 The axial resultant in each module segment is assumed to
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 be proportional to the axial stiffness of that segment (Fig.1g).
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Local buckling can be determined from a single module (Fig.1c,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 1e,1f) or from a multiple-module model (Figs 1d,3a,3b,23,24).
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 General buckling is determined from a number of analogous

 simpler modules (Fig.6) strung together. The stress constraints
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 are computed from a much simplified version of the code
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 in SUBROUTINE STRTHX of BIGBOSOR4, simplified because

 Next you will be asked to provide the fraction
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of the shell axial length to be used in the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 local buckling analysis. If the shell is
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 subjected to uniform end shortening (axial
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 compression), then this fraction of the total
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 shell length can be estimated by assuming that
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the critical buckling mode will have approximately
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 square buckles. The portion of the truss-core
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 sandwich most likely to buckle will probably have the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 longest unsupported width. Suppose the total
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 length of the cylindrical shell is 100 inches.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Suppose the width of the segment of the truss-core
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 sandwich most likely to buckle locally is 2 inches.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Then, for square buckles, the critical local buckling
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 mode will have approximately 50 half-waves along
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the total axial length of the cylindrical shell.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 In order to save computer time you don't want to
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 have to search over a large range of axial half-waves.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Therefore, in this example, choose a fraction, FACLEN,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of axial length equal to about 1/10th (FACLEN=0.1). Then
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the critical local buckling mode will have about 5 axial
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 half-waves over the length, 0.1 x LENGTH = 10 inches,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 and you can establish the range of axial half-waves
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to be covered to be from 1 to 10 axial halfwaves.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 (MLOWL = 1, MHIGHL = 10). The critical local buckling mode
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 will probably be somewhere near the middle of this range.

 and that this support is "rigid", that is, the cross

 to a BIGBOSOR4 model for local buckling that is sometimes

 unconservative. However, you can, with ILINKS = 1,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 optain an approximate idea how much the noodle support
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 increases the local buckling load factor. Compare Fig. 24b
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 with Fig. 9 to see how the "noodle support" index, ILINKS=1,
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 affects local buckling. NOTE: Gaps between shell

 segments are never used in the general buckling models.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 ILINKS = 2 means a BIGBOSOR4 local buckling model analogous
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to the elaborate 22-segment module depicted in Fig. 4
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 except that two additional thick layers are added to the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 little shell segments that surround each noodle gap: an
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 inner thick layer and an outer thick layer. These extra
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 layers act to prevent meridional bending in the huge

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the little shell segments that surround each noodle gap

 It is recommended that you first optimize with ILINKS = 0

 and then, for the optimized design, see what results you

 You will next be asked to provide an index, ICLAMP, that

 governs the boundary condition to be applied to the two
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 model. (Those edges are always simply supported in the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 GENERAL buckling model.) ICLAMP = 0 means that the two
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 straight edges are unrestrained. ICLAMP = 1 means that the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 two straight edges in the LOCAL buckling model are clamped.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 If you plan to use three modules or more in the LOCAL
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 buckling analysis, then ICLAMP = 1 is the best choice.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 However, the use of more than three modules in the LOCAL
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 buckling analysis leads to long computer times for
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 optimization. If you plan to use one module for LOCAL
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 buckling (Fig. 2 in Reference [1]), then the best choice
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 for ICLAMP depends on the case. If the truss-core sandwich
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 is to be made of isotropic material, then ICLAMP = 1 seems
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to be the best choice. If laminated composite material is
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 to be used then ICLAMP = 0 seems to be the best choice.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 If you don't have a preference, ICLAMP = 0 is the more
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 conservative choice. You can optimize with the use of a
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 one-module LOCAL buckling model, then check the optimized
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 design with a multi-module LOCAL buckling model (Fig. 3 in
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Reference [1]) with both ICLAMP = 1 and ICLAMP = 0. If it
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 turns out that there is a significant difference in the two
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 predictions, you can do more optimization, this time with
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 a multi-module LOCAL buckling model with at least three
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?

 Next, you will be asked to provide the mesh density

 to be used in the various STAGS models. You will be asked
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 for the following:
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 1. NROWSL = number of rows in the STAGS local buckling model
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 2. NROWSG = number of rows in the STAGS general buckling model
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 3. NCOLSG = number of columns in each segment of the STAGS
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 general buckling model.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 A suggestion: NROWSL = 51, NROWSG = 101, NCOLSG = 5 (Fig.20).
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 If, after you have executed STAGS with the use of both the
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 local buckling and general buckling models, you can always
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 restart the specific case with more appropriate values used

 for NROWSL, NROWSG, and NCOLSG.
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
  
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 Keep in mind that local buckles tend to be square, and
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 that the axial length of the STAGS model for local buckling
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 is equal to FACLEN x LENGTH. You can compute what will
 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 probably be close to the axial half-wavelength of the

 y         $ Are there more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 that the local buckles are squarish and the axial length

 of the STAGS local buckling model is FACLEN x LENGTH.

 number of modules for local buckling
 y         $ Do you want to include a "help" paragraph?
 NMODULL is the number of modules, each of which
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 contains 22 shell segments (Fig.4). In this application
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 the best answer is usually 3  (that is, three modules).
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 That is because the buckling (or stress) model
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 that consists of 22 shell segments is used
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 for obtaining LOCAL behavior, such as local

 buckling. Only three modules of 22 shell segments each
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 is needed for the determination of LOCAL behavior
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 with fair accuracy. However, there is some dependence
 y         $ Any more lines in the "help" paragraph?
 of the local buckling load on the number of modules,
