10.1  Are you correcting, adding to, or using an existing file?
10.2   
      In BOSDEC, yes or no or help answers to prompts for your
      input must be in the form Y or N or H, respectively. (capital
      letter, one character only, please!)

      Usually, your answer will be N. However, if you are rerunning
      BOSDEC
      and you have a good partial or complete file NAME.ALL
      and you want to complete your interactive session or simply rerun
      BOSDEC
      then answer Y.

      Note that you may only add entries after the last entry in the
      existing file. In order to change the file in other respects,
      you must edit it using the VAX edit mode.

20.1  Do you want a tutorial session and tutorial output?
20.2
      If you answer Y, you will see explanations after
      most prompts. The prompts and further explanations of them
      will be reproduced on your output file.

      *************  THIS IS "BOSDEC" ("BOSOR4 DECK") ***************
      *************  by David Bushnell, Dept. L9-24   ***************

      The purpose of this program is to set up an input file, *.ALL,
      for the BOSOR4 computer program for analysis of shells of
      revolution. Please see the following papers and a book by
      D. Bushnell for information about BOSOR4:

      1. "BOSOR4: program for stress, buckling and vibration of
         complex shells of revolution" in STRUCTURAL MECHANICS
         SOFTWARE SERIES, Vol. 1, (N. Perrone and W. Pilkey, editors)
         University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville, 1977,
         pp. 11-131.
      2. Computers & Structures, Vol. 4,  1974, pp. 399-435
      3. Computers & Structures, Vol. 18, 1984, pp. 471-536
      4. COMPUTERIZED BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF SHELLS, Nijhoff, 1985

      In this particular case the shell is a "wavy" cylindrical
      shell of length, AXIAL, and nominal radius, RADIUS, and
      thickness, t. The "wavy" shell consists of several segments.

      You supply simple information, such as AXIAL, t, RADIUS,
      the number of half-waves, NWAVES, over the length
      of the shell, amplitude, AMPLIT, of the waviness, material
      properties and boundary conditions, and BOSDEC automatically
      generates the multi-segment BOSOR4 model. The material is
      assumed to be linear elastic. The shell is monocoque
      (unstiffened). The wall can be either isotropic or laminated
      composite. You can do either a geometrically nonlinear
      axisymmetric stress analysis (INDIC=0) or a linear non-
      axisymmetric bifurcation buckling analysis (INDIC = 1). 

      A typical runstream for obtaining behavior of the "wavy"
      cylindrical shell is:
         bosdeclog      (enable BOSDEC command, "bosdec")
         bosdec         (provide input AXIAL, t, RADIUS, etc.
                         an "echo" file, *.WAV, is generated,
                         in which "*" represents your name for
                         the case. "bosdec" generates input for
                         the BOSOR4 program, the file, *.ALL)

         bosor4log      (enable the BOSOR4 command set.)
         bosorall       (run BOSOR4. Generates *.OUT file)
         bosorplot      (generate BOSOR4 plots)
         cp *.WAV *bos.WAV (save the input for "bosdec")
         cleanup        (delete files with name "*" except
                         *.ALL and *.DOC)
         cp *bos.WAV *.WAV (restore the "bosdec" input, *.WAV)
      ***********************************************************

85.1  BOSOR4 model type (1 or 2), MODLB4
85.2 
      MODLB4 = 1 corresponds to a model with just wavy segments.
      There is no initial segment in which the waviness is "smeared".
 
      MODLB4 = 2 corresponds to a model in which the wavy segments
      are connected to an initial segment in which the waviness is
      "smeared".

90.2 

100.1 Length of cylindrical shell, AXIAL
100.2  

102.1 Average nominal radius of cylindrical shell, RADIUS
102.2
      The waviness "oscillates" about RADIUS, with a peak of value
      equal to AMPLIT both above RADIUS and below RADIUS.

103.1 Total wall thickness, t
103.2

105.1 Number of axial halfwaves in wavy part of cyl., NWAVES
105.2
      NWAVES must be an EVEN number greater than or equal to 2
      because symmetry is used at both ends of the wavy section.

107.1 Axial length of one halfwave of the wavy pattern, WAVLEN
107.2 
     
110.1 Amplitude of waviness, AMPLIT
110.2

112.0
      You will next be asked to choose a "wavy" shape, via an
      index, IWAVE:
         IWAVE = 2 means that there exist only toroidal segments
                   in the "wavy" shape, that is, the segmented
                   BOSOR4 model will contain only two segments
                   per complete axial wave: one segment for the
                   part of the axial wave that is inward and one
                   segment for the part of the axial wave that is
                   outward. You can use this model for a sinusoidal
                   type of axial waviness.

         IWAVE = 3 means that the segmented BOSOR4 model will have
                   alternating straight (conical) and curved
                   (toroidal) segments. You can use this model
                   either for "wavy" shell with "ridges" (relatively
                   long conical segments combined with short
                   toroidal segments) or for a bellows type of shell
                   in which the amplitude of the waviness is larger
                   than the meridional radius of curvature of the
                   toroidal segments.

113.1 Which type of waviness (IWAVE = 2 or 3) do you want? IWAVE
113.2
      IWAVE=2 means that the wavy shell consists entirely of
              toroidal segments.
      IWAVE=3 means that the wavy shell consists of alternating
              straight (conical) and curved (toroidal) segments.

115.0
      You have just provided NWAVES and AMPLIT:
         NWAVES = number of axial halfwaves over the shell length.
         AMPLIT = amplitude of the waviness.
      You will next be asked to provide the variable, RADSML:
         RADSML = local meridional radius of curvature.
      There are lots of combinations that are "illegal", that is,
      for which the shell wall is not smooth or has gaps. Don't
      worry. BOSDEC will tell you to try another combination.
      If this happens, the best thing to do is leave NWAVES and
      AMPLIT alone and change RADSML. As soon as BOSDEC
      determines that you have a "legal" combination of NWAVES,
      AMPLIT, and RADSML, it will continue to ask you for more
      input data.

120.1 Local meridional radius of curvature, RADSML
120.2
      Small values of RADSML lead to a shell wall that has a
      "zig-zag" meridian, that is, it consists mostly of
      conical segments connected by much shorter toroidal
      segments. If RADSML is too small, such that each toroidal
      segment length is less than six wall thicknesses, BOSDEC
      will tell you to try doubling RADSML. You may have to 
      do this doubling several times to get a "legal" wall shape.

      Larger values of RADSML lead to a smoother waviness. If RADSML
      is too large, then there isn't enough space for connecting
      conical segments between toroidal segments, and BOSDEC will
      tell you to reduce RADSML.

      Next, you will be asked to provide the number, NMESHS, of
      meridional nodal points in each of the straight (conical)
      segments, followd by the number, NMESHC, of meridional
      nodal points in each of the curved (toroidal) segments.
      The number of nodal points you specify depends on the
      relative lengths of the straight and curved segments and
      on the number, NWAVES, of axial halfwaves over the length
      of the cylindrical shell.

      Unless otherwise instructed, you should probably use
      something like NMESHS = 21, NMESHC = 21 . However, you may
      well want to do convergence studies with respect to NMESHS
      and NMESHC, especially if you have relatively few axial
      halfwaves over the length of the wavy cylindrical shell.

      If BOSDEC has determined that either the straight segment
      or the curved segment is very short (less than 10 thicknesses)
      BOSDEC will suggest that you use fewer nodal points in that
      segment. If BOSDEC has determined that the straight segment
      is much longer than the curved segment or visa versa, then
      BOSDEC will suggest that you use more nodal points in the
      much longer segment. If the curved segment spans more than
      90 degrees, then BOSDEC will suggest that you consider using
      a higher number for NMESHC.

185.1 Number of nodal points in each STRAIGHT segment, NMESHS
185.2
      Must be less than 98. Suggestion: 21

186.1 Number of nodal points in each  CURVED  segment, NMESHC
186.2 
      Must be less than 98. Suggestion: 21

188.1 Number of nodal points in "smeared" segment, NMESH1
188.2 
      The "smeared" segment is the segment in which the waviness
      is "smeared" (averaged). That is, the wall properties (6x6
      C(i,j) constitutive matrix) derived by WAVYCYL are used
      for the wall of a straight-walled cylindrical shell that is
      equivalent to the wavy cylindrical shell.

189.1 Max. number of d.o.f. in the buckling problem, MAXNOD
189.2 
      Ordinarily, use MAXNOD = 3000
      Sometimes use MAXNOD = 10000 for checking optimized designs.

190.1 Enter index (1=s.s.; 2=clamped) for boundary condition
190.2 
      1 means simple support conditions are applied at the
        bottom end of the cylindrical shell.

      2 means clamped conditions are applied at the bottom
        end of the cylindrical shell.

      Remember: Symmetry is ALWAYS applied at the top end of the
      cylindrical shell.

200.1 Starting number of circumferential waves, N0B
200.2
      Use a number that is greater than or equal to 1

210.1 Ending number of circumferential waves [see H(elp)],NMAXB
210.2
      You can make NMAXB = N0B if you want, then explore a wide
      range of circ. waves with use of the BOSOR4 processors
      RESETUP/RESTART.  Or you can explore a range here. If you
      want very compact output, use RESETUP/RESTART for the wide
      range of circ. wavenumbers n.

220.1 Increment in number of circumferential waves, INCRB
220.2 
      It's a good idea to make the increment of circ. wavenumber n
      equal to a certain percentage of n, say 10 per cent. Then
      you won't get results for lots of n when n corresponding
      to the critical (lowest) buckling load factor is very high.

230.1 Number of eigenvalues for each circ. wavenumber, NVEC
230.2 
      Usually you want only the lowest eigenvalue for each circ.
      wavenumber n. However, sometimes you may want more than one
      eigenvalue for each n. Use NVEC = 1 if you are exploring
      a wide range of circ. wavenumber n.

384.0 
      Input for laminated composite wall...

385.1 number of layers in the wall
385.2  
      NOTE: the maximum number of layers total is 90.

386.1 layer index (1,2,...), for layer no.
386.2  
      A layer index implies the following "bundle" of properties:

         1. thickness of the layer
         2. winding angle of the layer (degrees between the
            normal to the screen and the direction in which the
            modulus E1 (fiber direction) is measured)
         3. material type of the layer

      The three properties just listed are identical in two different
      layers if both of these layers have the same layer index.

387.1 Is this a new layer type?
388.0 
      thickness, winding angle, material for layer index

389.1 thickness for layer index no.
390.1 winding angle (deg.) for layer index no.
390.2 
      The definition of winding angle is: the angle in degrees
      measured from the meridional direction to the direction in
      which the fiber modulus E1 is measured. The winding angle
      must be constant along the meridional coordinate.

391.1 material index (1,2,...) for layer index no.
392.0  
      You will next be asked to provide material properties corres-
      ponding to the material types that you have already indicated.

393.1 Next material type... Is material new for material type
393.2 
      If any of the materials in previous segments with composite
      layups (NWALL=4) was the same as the present material, answer
      N. If this is a new material, answer Y.

394.0 
      In the following:

        E1 = modulus in the fiber direction
        E2 = modulus transverse to fibers in the plane of the layer
         G = in-plane shear modulus
        NU = Poisson's ratio: NU = NU12 = NU21 * E2/E1
             NOTE: the NU you provide is the smallest of the two if
                   E1 > E2.  This is a bit unusual, so BEWARE!

395.1 modulus in the fiber direction, E1
396.1 modulus transverse to fibers,   E2
397.1 in-plane shear modulus,          G
398.1 small Poisson's ratio,          NU
399.1 thermal expansion along fibers, A1
400.1 transverse thermal expansion,   A2
401.1 residual stress temperature (positive),TEMPTUR
401.2 
      Degrees must be consistent with thermal expansion coefficients,
      A1 and A2 given previously.  What is wanted here is the
      difference between the setting temperature and room temperature,
      that is, the delta temperature that governs the magnitude of
      residual stresses and deformations in the panel due to curing.
      TEMPTUR should be zero or positive.

402.1 mass density (e.g. lb-sec**2/in. Aluminum=.00025), DENS
402.2 
      What is wanted is mass density m, not weight density mg.

403.0 
      Next, you will be asked to provide five maximum allowable
      stresses:
         maximum tensile stress along fibers,         sig1(tension)
         maximum compressive stress along fibers,     sig1(comp.)
         maximum tensile stress normal to fibers,     sig2(tension)
         maximum compressive stress normal to fibers, sig2(comp.)
         maximum in-plane shear stress,               sig12
      These maximum allowables correspond to a single lamina of
      composite material (tape or cloth). The thickness of a single
      lamina is often something like 0.005 inches.

404.1 maximum tensile stress along fibers, matl
405.1 max compressive stress along fibers, matl
406.1 max tensile stress normal to fibers, matl  
407.1 max compress stress normal to fibers,matl  
408.1 maximum  shear  stress  in  material type                 
409.1 NRS  = control (0 or 1) for addition of smeared stiffeners
409.2  
      NRS = 0 means no smeared stiffeners;
      NRS = 1 means yes, smeared stiffeners to be added.

620.0 
      You may wish to limit the number of meridional stations at
      which you want stresses listed in each lamina of the composite
      wall. Otherwise you may get too much output. Please indicate
      next for which nodal points in this segment you want stress
      output. Don't worry about limiting the output too much. You
      can always do RESTARTs later and identify new points for
      stress output if you see a need for it.

622.1 Do you want output for all the nodal points in Segment
624.0
      Next, give the nodal points in increasing order...

626.1 Nodal point (e.g. 1 or 2 or 3 or . . . )
628.1 Any more nodal points for stress output in this segment?
