1.0   BOSOR4 INPUT DATA, INTERACTIVE MODE

      Initial prompts are short, and may contain data names a new
      user is not familiar with.  Please type H instead of
      any datum called for, and you will get more information on that
      datum.

      Page numbers contained in some of the prompts refer to the
      article: "BOSOR4--Program for stress, buckling, and vibration
      of complex shells of revolution," STRUCTURAL MECHANICS
      SOFTWARE SERIES--VOL. I, (N. Perrone & W. Pilkey, editors),
      University Press of Virginia, 1977, pp. 11-143.  This is a
      user's manual that contains additional discussion and figures.

      For many examples of shell buckling, discussions of imperfection
      sensitivity, and descriptions of the physics of shell buckling
      from an engineer's point of view, please see the book,
      COMPUTERIZED BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF SHELLS, by D. Bushnell,
      published by Martinus Nijhoff, Kluwer Academic Publishers,
      190 Old Derby St., Hingham, MA 02043,or Dordrecht,
      The Netherlands, 1985.

1.1   Title of case (42 characters or less)
2.1   INDIC = analysis type indicator
2.2  
       0= nonlinear axisymmetric stress (and collapse) analysis,
      -2= stability determinant calculated for increasing load,
      -1= bifurcation buckling with nonlinear prebuckling analysis,
       1= bifurcation buckling with "linear"  prebuckling analysis;
          (Actually the prebuckling analysis is the same as for
           INDIC = -1.  However, the applied load is never changed
           during a case.  Linear behavior is exhibited as long as
           the user applies a load that is very small compared to
           the design load.)

       2= modal vibration with axisymmetric nonlinear prestress.
       3= linear nonsymmetric stress analysis;
          (Note that the maximum number of circumferential harmonics
           has been increased from 20 to the following:

             NHARM MAX.  = MIN [90, 1250/NSEG]

           in which NSEG is the number of shell segments.)

       4= bifurcation buckling with linear nonsymmetric prebuckling.

3.1   NPRT = output options (1=minimum, 2=medium, 3=maximum)
4.1   NLAST = plot options  (-1=none, 0=geometry, 1=u,v,w)
4.2     
      NLAST = -1 means no plotting;
               0 means plots of undeformed and deformed
                 geometry only;
               1 means plots of geometry and u,v,w vs arc length.

5.1   ISTRES= output control (0=resultants, 1=sigma, 2=epsilon)
5.2    
      ISTRES = 0 means stress resultants will be output
             = 1 means extreme fiber stresses will be output
                 (valid for single-layer isotropic walls only);
             = 2 means strains and curvature changes will be
                 output (any shell wall type).

      If you want stress output for an orthotropic layered shell,
      set ISTRES = 2 and compute the stresses from the strains and
      changes in curvature of the reference surface.

      If INDIC is different from 0 or 3, ISTRES will be set = 0
      by BOSOR4 regardless of what you choose for it.

6.1   IPRE  = indicator for prebuckling stress calculation (0 or 1)
6.2     
        0 = prebuckling state read from input,
        1 = prebuckling state calculated by BOSOR4.

7.1   JPLOT = indicator for the number of zoomed plots
8.1   KPLOT(I) = location of Ith station for expanded plots 
8.2      
       Example:  1053 means Segment #1, mesh point #53

9.1   LPLOT(I) = magnification factor for Ith expanded plot
10.1  NSEG  = number of shell segments (less than 295)
12.0
      Your title contains the string, "prism" or "Prism" or "PRISM".
      Therefore, bigbosor4 will assume you have a prismatic shell
      rather than a shell of revolution. See ITEM NO. 31 in the
      file, ...bigbosor4/doc/bosor4.news

13.1  AXIALL= length of the prismatic shell
15.1  IFACTR= multiply previous load step by IFACTR if easy converg.
16.1  NSTART= starting number of circ. waves (lin. stress analysis)
16.2    
      BOSOR4 is valid for both positive and negative values of the
      circumferential wave number, n.  For positive n the normal
      displacement w varies around the circumference as sin(n*theta),
      whereas for negative n,  w varies as cos(n*theta).  The table
      below shows how other variables and loads vary with + or - n:

       ==============================================================
17.1  NFIN  = ending number of circ. waves (linear stress analysis)
17.2   
      NOTE...The number of circumferential harmonics, NHARM, is
      given by   NHARM = IABS(NSTART-NFIN)/IABS(INCR) + 1  . The
      maximum permitted is:
        NHARM MAX. = MIN [90, 1250/NSEG]
      INCR is the increment or decrement in the number of circ. waves.

18.1  INCR  = step in number of circ. waves (linear stress)
18.2   
      INCR may be positive or negative.

19.1  N0B   = starting number of circ. waves (buckling analysis)
20.1  NMINB = minimum number of circ. waves  (buckling analysis)
21.1  NMAXB = maximum number of circ. waves  (buckling analysis)
22.1  INCRB = increment in number of circ. waves (buckling)
23.1  NVEC  = number of eigenvalues for each wave number
24.1  NDIST = number of circ. stations for meridional output
24.2
      Use a small number. On big models, use NDIST = 1 and take
      advantage of the restart capability.

25.1  THETA = circ. stations (in deg.) for meridional output.
26.1  NCIRC = number of meridional stations for circ. distibutions
26.2   
      Use a small number, less than 5.

27.1  ITHETA= meridional location for circumferential output
27.2   
              Example: 1011 means segment #1, mesh point #11

28.1  NTHETA= number of output points along circ. from 0 to THETAM.
28.2   
      Use maximum of 91 points.
29.1  THETAM= range of circumferential Fourier expansion & output
29.2   
      Circumferential distributions are printed and plotted for
      0 < THETA < THETAM.

      Loads expanded in Fourier series over -THETAM < THETA < +THETAM

      THETAM is usually equal to 180 deg.  THETAM must be less
      than or equal to 180 deg.

30.1  THETAS= Nx & Ny along this meridian used in buckling analysis.
30.2   
      Prebuckling stress resultant distribution corresponding to
      THETA = THETAS is assumed to be axisymmetric in the stability
      analysis.

31.0
      IPRISM = 1 in this BIGBOSOR4 case.
      Therefore, the BIGBOSOR4 analysis applies to a true prismatic
      shell or true prismatic assemblage of shells. The next four
      input data, N0B, NMINB, NMAXB, INCRB, that you must supply
      are numbers of axial half waves, N0B, NMINB, NMAXB, along the
      length, AXIALL, of the prismatic shell and the increment,
      INCRB, of axial half waves to be used in the search for the
      buckling load factor and mode shape of the true prismatic
      shell structure. Please see the file,
      .../bigbosor4/case/prismatic/prismatic.tar.gz
      for complete information on true prismatic shells and how
      the true-prismatic-shell option has been included into
      BIGBOSOR4.

32.1  N0B   = starting number of axial half waves (buckling analysis)
34.1  NMINB = minimum number of axial half waves  (buckling analysis)
36.1  NMAXB = maximum number of axial half waves  (buckling analysis)
38.1  INCRB = increment in number of axial half waves (buckling)
40.1  IPRISM=0 for shell of revolution, 1 for true prismatic shell
40.2 
      Please see the file, .../bigbosor4/case/prismatic/prismatic.tar.gz,
      for complete information about true prismatic shells. In order
      to unpack the compressed tar file, prismatic.tar.gz, type the
      following two commands:
      gunzip prismatic.tar.gz
      tar xvf prismatic.tar
      Then read the file, prismaticshell.readme .

45.0  
      Next, please provide factors P and DP,  TEMP and DTEMP, which
      are multipliers for the pressure, surface traction, and
      temperature distributions in load system "A".  Note that these
      multipliers are applied only to load system "A".  They are not
      applied to load system "B".  (Load system "A" represents the
      "eigenvalue" load system.  Load system "B" is constant
      throughout the case.)

47.1  P      = pressure or surface traction multiplier
47.2   
      The factor P is applied only to the distributed mechanical
      loads in load system "A".  For example, if INDIC is less than
      three (axisymmetric loading), the normal pressure along Segment
      No. i for load system "A" is given in the first load step by:

        pressure = P*PN(j)         j = 1, 2, ....NMESH(i)

      in which PN(j) is the meridional pressure distribution.

      See pp. 58-60 for further discussion of loading parameters.

48.1  DP     = pressure or surface traction multiplier increment
49.1  TEMP   = temperature rise multiplier
49.2   
      See pp. 58 for a discussion.  The discussion included
      for the pressure multiplier P applies here also.

50.1  DTEMP  = temperature rise multiplier increment
51.1  Number of load steps
51.2  
      Must be less than 25.  It is generally advisable to use less
      than about 10.  In big cases use about 3, look at your results,
      then do RUN RESTART to do more.


52.1  FSTART = starting load (see p 58)
53.1  FMAX   = maximum load  (see p 58)
54.1  DF     = load increment ( see p 58-60)
55.1  OMEGA  = angular vel. about axis of revolution (rad/sec)
56.1  DOMEGA = angular velocity increment (rad/sec)
57.1  OMEGDR = driving frequency for harmonic forcing (rad/sec)
58.1  GLATRL = no. of g's lateral forcing (base excitation only)
59.1  GAXIAL = no. of g's axial forcing (base excitation only)
60.0  
      Four kinds of constraint conditions exist in BOSOR4:
  
       1. constraints to ground (e.g. boundary condtions)
       2. juncture compatibility conditions
       3. regularity conditions at poles (where radius r = 0)
       4. constraints to prevent rigid body displacements
  
      See the fig. on p. 54, for example.  There is a constraint to
      ground (boundary condition) at Segment 8, Point 8; there are
      several juncture conditions (e.g. Seg. 2, Pt. 1 is connected
      to Seg. 1, Pt. 9); there are several poles (e.g. Seg. 1,
      Pt. 1).  Note that if a shell is not anywhere attached to
      ground, such as is the case for the example shown on p. 57,
      the user must choose a node at which to prevent rigid body
      motion. This node is to be chosen in the section below where
      the user is asked about constraints to ground. In a section
      following the "constraints-to-ground" section, the user will
      be asked to provide specific data for preventing rigid body
      motion.  Types of rigid body motion are shown on p. 56. An
      example of appropriate input data is listed on p. 57, bottom.
    
61.1  How many segments in the structure?
62.1  Number of poles (places where r=0) in SEGMENT
62.2    
      Your response should probably be 0 or 1.

64.1  IPOLE = nodal point number of pole, IPOLE
66.1  At how many stations is this segment constrained to ground?
66.2  
      This count does not include poles. Multiple constraints to
      ground within any one segment must be spaced at intervals of
      at least 3 nodal points.

68.1  INODE = nodal point number of constraint to ground, INODE
70.1  IUSTAR=axial displacement constraint (0 or 1 or 2)
70.2   
      The nature of the constraint condition is governed by four
      integers which, in the case of a connection to ground, 
      indicate whether USTAR, VSTAR, WSTAR, and CHI are free 
      or constrained to be zero or forced to have certain finite
      values. For example, IUSTAR may be 0 or 1 or 2 :
         IUSTAR = 0 means that USTAR is free at the node INODE
         IUSTAR = 1 means that USTAR   =  0  at the node INODE
         IUSTAR = 2 means that USTAR is imposed at  node INODE
      For example, simple support at the node INODE on a cylindrical
      shell is indicated by:
         IUSTAR = 0 (axial displacement USTAR is free)
         IVSTAR = 1 (circumferential displacement VSTAR is zero)
         IWSTAR = 1 (radial displacement WSTAR is zero)
         ICHI   = 0 (meridional rotation CHI is free)
      An example of imposed axial displacement is:
         IUSTAR = 2 (axial displacement USTAR is imposed)
         IVSTAR = 0 (circumferential displacement VSTAR is free)
         IWSTAR = 0 (radial displacement WSTAR is free)
         ICHI   = 1 (meridional rotation CHI is zero)
      Note that the constraints are applied in an (axial,radial)
      sense, not in a (meridional,normal) sense. At the bottom of
      p. 51 the directions of displacement components USTAR and
      WSTAR are shown, as well as CHI and V.  VSTAR is the same as V.

71.1  IVSTAR=circumferential displacement(0=free,1=0,2=imposed)
72.1  IWSTAR=radial displacement(0=free,1=constrained,2=imposed)
73.1  ICHI=meridional rotation (0=free,1=constrained,2=imposed)
74.1  D1    = radial component of offset of ground support
74.2   
      See Fig. A1 on p. 52

75.1  D2    = axial component of offset of ground support
80.1  Is this constraint the same for both prebuckling and buckling?
80.2   
      Different conditions may exist in the prebuckling phase from
      those in the buckling or vibration phase.  The most common
      case involves antisymmetric buckling or vibration at a
      symmetry plane.  A common oversight is the failure to run
      a case in which buckling and vibration modes are sought
      which are antisymmetric with respect to a structural plane
      of symmetry.  The user should check for modes both symmetrical
      and antisymmetrical at symmetry planes.

      If IUSTAR or IWSTAR or ICHI were 2 (imposed displacement), you
      must reset them in the bifurcation buckling analysis to either
      0 or 1  (probably 1, as an imposed displacement in the pre-
      buckling analysis implies no freedom of motion during buckling
      deformations).

81.1  IUSTARB= axial displacement for buckling or vibration phase
81.2   
      This and the following three items refer to the constraint
      conditions to be active during the bifurcation buckling
      or modal vibration phase of the analysis.  Apparently at
      least one of these conditions is different from what it
      is in the prebuckling analysis.

82.1  IVSTARB= circ. displacement for buckling or vibration phase
83.1  IWSTARB= radial displacement for buckling or vibration
84.1  ICHIB  = meridional rotation for buckling or vibration
86.1  Is this segment joined to any lower-numbered segments?
86.2   
      The segments are numbered 1, 2, . . .NSEG, in the order
      in which input data were provided for them.  We are
      concerned here only with those segments joined to the
      current segment and haviong preceeded it in the segment-
      by-segment input phase.

88.1  At how may stations is this segment joined to previous segs.?
88.2   
      Note that such junctions must be at intervals of at least 3
      nodal points, no closer.

90.1  INODE = node in current segment (ISEG) of junction, INODE
92.1  JSEG  = segment no. of lowest segment involved in junction
94.1  JNODE = node in lowest segmnt (JSEG) of junction
96.1  IUSTAR= axial displacement (0=not slaved, 1=slaved)
96.2   
      The nature of the juncture condition is governed by four
      integers, IUSTAR, IVSTAR, IWSTAR, and ICHI, which
      indicate whether USTAR, VSTAR, WSTAR, and CHI are not
      slaved or are slaved at the junction.  Most of the time you
      will supply the following input:

         IUSTAR = 1 (axial displacement u is slaved)
         IVSTAR = 1 (circumferential displacement v is slaved)
         IWSTAR = 1 (radial displacement w is slaved)
         ICHI   = 1 (meridional rotation CHI is slaved)

      Note that the constraints are applied in an (axial,radial)
      sense, not in a (meridional,normal) sense.
      See figure at bottom of p. 51; also figure on p. 54.
98.1  IVSTAR= circumferential displacement (0=not slaved, 1=slaved)

100.1 IWSTAR= radial displacement (0=not slaved, 1=slaved)
102.1 ICHI  = meridional rotation (0=not slaved, 1=slaved)
104.1 D1    = radial component of juncture gap
104.2  
      See Fig. A1, p.52

106.1 D2    = axial component of juncture gap
108.1 Is this constraint the same for both prebuckling and buckling?
108.2  
      Different conditions may exist in the prebuckling phase from
      those in the buckling or vibration phase.  For example,
      we may want to simulate the development of a plastic hinge
      by using IUSTAR, IVSTAR, IWSTAR, ICHI = 1, 1, 1, 1  in the
      prebuckling analysis and 1, 1, 1, 0 in the buckling phase.

110.1 IUSTARB= axial displacement for buckling or vibration phase
110.2  
      This and the following three items refer to the constraint
      conditions to be active during the bifurcation buckling
      or modal vibration phase of the analysis.  Apparently at
      least one of these conditions is different from what it
      is in the prebuckling analysis.

111.1 IVSTARB= circ. displacement for buckling or vibration phase
112.1 IWSTARB= radial displacement for buckling or vibration
113.1 ICHIB  = meridional rotation for buckling or vibration
115.0   
      It may be necessary to provide additional constraint to
      ground in order to prevent rigid body motion.  All possible
      types of rigid body motion are shown on p. 56. Rigid body
      motion corresponds to n = 0 or n = 1 circumferential waves.
      There is no rigid body component for any harmonic with n
      greater than or equal to 2.  For modal vibration problems rigid
      body motion need be prevented only if the structure is loaded.

120.1 Given existing constraints, are rigid body modes possible?
120.2  
      Whether n=0 and/or n = 1 rigid body modes are possible
      or not depends on the constraints to ground that you have
      already supplied.  Please read p. 56 for examples of
      rigid body motion.

121.1 Do you wish to prevent rigid body motion?
121.2  
      You must prevent the possibility of rigid body motion if the
      structure is loaded in any way.  You need not prevent rigid
      body motion for modal vibration problems involving unloaded
      structures.

122.0   
      Please establish a location (segment no. and nodal point no.)
      at which to prevent rigid body motion.  This location must
      not correspond to a pole (a place where r=0).  It must corres-
      pond to one of the nodes involved in a "constraint-to-ground"
      condition. (For example, see the data labeled "extra condition"
      at the bottom of p. 57.)

123.1 ISEG  = segment no. at which to prevent rigid body motion
124.1 INODE = node no. at which to prevent rigid body motion
125.0  
      Rigid body motion for n = 0 and for n = 1 is prevented by
      assigning 1's to certain of the control integers, IUSTAR,
      IVSTAR, IWSTAR, and ICHI. Which of these should be unity and
      which should be zero depends on your existing constraints to
      ground.  The usual practice is to assign IUSTAR=1, IVSTAR=1,
      IWSTAR = 0, and ICHI = 0.

126.1 IUSTAR= axial n=0 rigid body constraint (0=none, 1=some)
126.2  
      IUSTAR should usually be set equal to 1 here.

127.1 IVSTAR= circ. n=0 rigid body constraint (usually equals 1)
128.1 IWSTAR= radial n=0 rigid body constraint (usually equals 0)
129.1 ICHI  = meridional rot. rigid body constraint
130.1 IUSTAR= axial n=1 rigid body constraint (usually equals 1)
131.1 IVSTAR= circ. n=1 rigid body constraint (usually equals 1)
132.1 IWSTAR= radial n=1 rigid body constraint (usually equals 0)
133.1 ICHI  = meridional rot. rigid body constraint
134.1 Is there a tank filled with fluid?
134.2 
      This section is entered only if there exists at least one
      non-zero component of acceleration of gravity (axial, lateral,
      or both), such as would be experienced by a payload in a
      launch vehicle.

      If you answer "Y" (you are allowed only one fluid-filled tank
      per case!), you will next be asked to supply the following
      information:

       1. The WEIGHT density (e.g. lb/in**3) of the fluid, GAMMA
       2. The axial length of the tank, AXLONG
       3. The radius of the largest parallel circle in the tank, RBIG
       4. The axial coordinate of the bottom of the tank, ZBEGIN
       5. The segment numbers that comprise the tank, ISTANK(j),j=1,2,..
       6. Whether the inside of the tank is on the left or right side
          of the wall as you travel along the meridian.

      NOTE: The tank is assumed to be completely full of the fluid.
      BOSOR4 uses the above information plus the meridional geometry
      of the tank and the axial and lateral g's, GAXIAL and GLATRL,
      to which the tank is subjected to compute the pressure of the
      fluid acting on the tank wall:

      p(fluid) =
        k*GAMMA{abs(GLATRL)*[RBIG -(GLATRL/abs(GLATRL))*r*cos(theta)]
              +GAXIAL*[0.5*AXLONG*(1+GAXIAL/abs(GAXIAL)) -(z-ZBEGIN)]}

      in which r is the radius of the parallel circle at z, z is the
      axial coordinate of an arbitrary point on the tank meridian, and
      theta is the circumferential coordinate. The factor k is +1.0 if
      the inside of the tank is on the left side of the wall as you
      travel along the meridian in the direction of increasing arc
      length, s; k= -1.0 otherwise. (See p 66, bottom, of "BOSOR4:

      Next, please provide the numbers of the segments of the tank wall
      that "see" the normal pressure applied by the fluid.
 
      NOTE: INCLUDE ONLY THOSE SEGMENTS THAT EXPERIENCE A DELTA-p
            from the fluid across the wall!

146.1 How many BOSOR4 segments in the tank "see" delta-p(fluid)?
146.2 
      NOTE: Include only those segments upon which a net fluid pressure
            acts on the wall of the tank!

148.1 Segment number, ISTANK
149.1 Is the inside of the tank to the left of increasing arc, s?
149.2 
      The pressure of the fluid acting on the tank wall is given by:

      p(fluid) =
        k*GAMMA{abs(GLATRL)*[RBIG -(GLATRL/abs(GLATRL))*r*cos(theta)]
              +GAXIAL*[0.5*AXLONG*(1+GAXIAL/abs(GAXIAL)) -(z-ZBEGIN)]}

      in which r is the radius of the parallel circle at z, z is the
      axial coordinate of an arbitrary point on the tank meridian, and
      theta is the circumferential coordinate. The factor k is +1.0 if
      the inside of the tank is on the left side of the wall as you
      travel along the meridian in the direction of increasing arc
      length, s; k= -1.0 otherwise. (See p 66, bottom, of "BOSOR4:

      If the loads in either Load Set A or Load Set B or both are
      not self-equilibrating, such as is true for a free shell
      subjected to a blast load from the side, you may want BOSOR4
      to compute the inertial reactions from the applied loads.
      This BOSOR does in the following way:
       1. BOSOR calculates the total mass, c.g. location, and
          mass moments of inertia of the entire structure.
       2. BOSOR calculates the total forces Fx, Fy, Fz applied at
          the origin of the global X,Y,Z cartesian coordinate
          system, and total moments Mx, My, Mz about these axes.
          The origin of the global X,Y,Z frame is on the axis of
          revolution at Z = 0. Note that in order for the mass
          properties (M, z(c.g.), I(c.g.), Iz) and forces Fx,Fy,Fz
          and moments Mx,My,Mz to be properly calculated you must have
          already provided the geometry of each segment of the
          structure in terms of the global Z coordinate.
       3. Given the six equations for rigid-body dynamics, accelerations
          of the c.g. and angular accelerations about the c.g. are
          calculated.
       4. The components of linear acceleration in the normal,
          meridional, and circumferential directions everywhere in the
          structure are then calculated. These accelerations
          yield inertial loads (F=ma!) that contribute to the line
          loads (from discrete ring inertia) and distributed loads
          corresponding to n = +1, n = 0, and n = -1 circumferential
          waves.
       The above steps 2., 3., and 4. are performed for either or both
       Load Set A and/or Load Set B, if you so indicate next.
       Please note that the calculations just described are performed
       only for INDIC = 3 or 4.
       Also note: You must of course supply masses for all the
       structural parts, even though you regard this as a statics
       problem.  No mass, no inertial reaction! Remember, the axial
       coordinate input for each segment must be global for this to
       work properly.

155.1 Do you want inertial reactions to Load Set A?
155.2 
      This calculation is only performed for INDIC = 3 or 4!
      Please answer N or NO if Load Set A consists only of thermal
      loads or applied displacements.

160.1 Do you want inertial reactions to Load Set B?
160.2 
      This calculation is only performed for INDIC = 3 or 4!
      Please answer N or NO if there is no Load Set B, or if
      Load Set B is only thermal or consists of applied displacements.
