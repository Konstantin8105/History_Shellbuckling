320.1 Choose an index (1 or 2 or . . .  15)
480.1 IOMGAB = control for OMEGA as "A" or "B" load (1 or 2)
480.2  
      IOMGAB = 1 means OMEGA (spin) is included in load set "A"
      IOMGAB = 2 means OMEGA        is included in load set "B"

490.1 For which purpose are you using RESTART (1 or 2)?
500.0   
      Your structure may contain segments that are very short
      compared to the whole model being analyzed here. This detail
      will not show up well in plots of the entire undeformed and
      deformed structure. Therefore you may wish to get expanded
      plots of these regions. Please identify these regions by
      segment number and give a magnification factor for each region.
      Note that the magnification factor must be an integer.
      The center of the expanded plot will be at the first point of
      the segment so identified. The extent of structure plotted
      will of course depend on the magnification factor you choose.

510.1 Are there any regions for which you want expanded plots?
520.1 Any more regions for which you want expanded plots?
530.1 Segment number for segment at center of expanded region
530.2  
      The first point in the segment will be at the center of
      the expanded plot.

540.1 Magnification factor (integer) for this expanded region
540.2  
      Use integers such as 5, 10, etc. Value depends on how much
      of the structure you want to include in the expanded region.
      A factor of unity would merely give you the entire structure
      again, so the smallest factor is 2.

550.1 Are you correcting, adding to, or checking an existing file?
550.2  
      If you are starting a new segment or starting the section on
      global variables and constraint conditions, the answer should
      be N.

      Note that you may only add entries after the last entry in the
      existing file. In order to change the file in other respects,
      you must edit it using the VAX edit mode.  Make sure that when
      you use VAX editing that the version number of the file remains
      unchanged.

555.1 Indicate what kind of file you want to modify (1 or 2)
555.2  
      1 indicates a file containing data for one of the segments
        of the structure, and global data that precede data
        for Segment 1;

      2 indicates the file containing global data and constraint
        conditions which follow all the segment data.

560.1 Indicate what kind of file you are adding to (1 or 2)
560.2
      1 indicates a file containing data for one of the segments
        of the structure;

      2 indicates the file containing global data and constraint
        conditions which follow all the segment data.

570.1 Which segment is this?
575.1 For which segment are you modifying the constraints?
580.1 How many segments in the structure?
582.1 Do you have a complete tori-ellipsoidal dome?
582.2
      If you answer "Y", BOSOR4 reflects the right-hand portion,
      input for which is depicted on p.66 of the BOSOR4 user's manual,
      over to the left side of the centerline of the dome, and the
      total arc length of the segment becomes double that of the
      segment you just provided geometry input data for. Note that
      you are permitted to answer "Y" only if the dome is closed at
      its apex.

      NOTE: INPUT FOR BOUNDARY AND/OR JUNCTION CONDITIONS MAY BE
            VERY TRICKY DUE TO POSSIBLE AUTOMATED MODIFICATION OF THE
            NUMBER OF NODAL POINTS IN THE "DOUBLED" TORI-ELLIPSOIDAL
            SEGMENT. IT IS BEST IF YOU ALWAYS USE:
                     NMESH  between 51 and 97 (preferably 97)
            FOR THE NUMBER OF NODES IN THIS SEGMENT. THEN THE END OF
            THE NEW "DOUBLED" SEGMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE
            SAME NODAL POINT NUMBER, NMESH, THAT YOU JUST SPECIFIED
            IN YOUR INPUT SESSION.  IF YOU ALWAYS USE NMESH = 97,
            THERE WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS BE ENOUGH NODES IN THE "DOUBLED"
            SEGMENT TO AVOID ELEMENT LOCKING.
      NOTE2:WHEN USING CALLOUTS, ALWAYS USE r (NOT z) AND FOR A CLOSED
            TOROID FOLLOW THE INPUT SCHEME LISTED IN THE EXAMPLE IN
            THE FILE ...bosor5/doc/bosor5.news, ITEM 2, DATED NOV 1995.

584.1 Is this segment an INNER part of the toroid?
584.2 
      By "INNER" is meant the part of the toroid with negative
      Gaussian curvature, the portion of the toroid with radius
      less than the radius, ALPHAT, to the center of the toroid.

      The OUTER part of the toroid is the part with positive
      Gaussian curvature, the portion of the toroid with radius
      greater than the radius, ALPHAT, to the center of the toroid.

601.1 Do you want to print out r(s), r'(s), etc. for this segment?
602.1 Do you want to print out the (z,r) coordinates (input data)?
603.1 Do you want to print out debugging quantities for geometry?
604.1 Do you want to print out output Fourier expansion of load?
605.1 Do you want to print out prestresses at meridional stations?
606.1 Do you want to print out ref. surf. location and thickness?
607.1 Do you want to print out the C(i,j) at meridional stations?
608.1 Do you want to print out thicknesses along the meridian?
609.1 Do you want to print out thicknesses along the meridian?
610.1 Do you want to print out distributed loads along meridian?
620.0 
      You may wish to limit the number of meridional stations at
      which you want stresses listed in each lamina of the composite
      wall. Otherwise you may get too much output. Please indicate
      next for which nodal points in this segment you want stress
      output. Don't worry about limiting the output too much. You
      can always do RESTARTs later and identify new points for
      stress output if you see a need for it.

622.1 Do you want output for all the nodal points in Segment
624.0
      Next, give the nodal points in increasing order...

626.1 Nodal point (e.g. 1 or 2 or 3 or . . . )
628.1 Any more nodal points for stress output in this segment?
702.1 Do you want response to harmonic forcing (INDIC = 3 or 4)?
704.1 Is the harmonic forcing thru base excitation?
706.1 Value of acceleration of gravity in this case's units
710.1 Do you want to list output for segment
720.1 Do you want to list output for several load steps?
730.1 Do you want to list prebuckling resultants and ring forces?
740.1 Do you want to list forces in the discrete rings, if any?
741.1 Do you want to suppress listing the prebuckling resultants?
742.1 Do you want to suppress listing the buckling modes?
750.1 Do you want response at resonance to base excitation?
750.2  
      You can type Y only if you have just run an INDIC = 2
      (modal vibration case) with n = 0 only or n = 1 only. (n is
      the number of circumferential waves.)  This program estimates
      the response by RSS (square root of the sum of the squares).
      The sum is over the number of modes calculated in the previous
      (INDIC = 2) run.  This program will handle
      response to harmonic excitation, response to random excitation,
      and response to shock. You will be asked to provide input data
      such as load factor (number of g's acceleration), damping
      factor, and/or spectral density.

770.0  
      To use this branch you must just have run a modal vibration
      analysis for a single number of circumferential waves: either
      n = 0 or n = 1. The purpose here is to find the response of the
      structure to either:

      1. sinusoidal excitation    or

      2. random excitation        or

      3. shock

780.1 Want more information?
790.0  

      There are four kinds of information that must be supplied
      in order to perform all of the three types of analysis just
      listed:

      a.  gravity in the units of this case (e.g. 386.4 in/sec**2)

      b.  a table of load factors or shock levels (g's) vs.
          frequency in hertz:                               [N = N(f)]

      c.  a table of damping factor vs. frequency in hertz: [B = B(f)]

      d. a table of spectral density vs. frequency in hertz:[W = W(f)],
         in which W is in units of g's-squared-per-hertz (N**2/hertz).

      For harmonic excitation you must supply a., b., and c.
      For random   vibration  you must supply a., c., and d.
      For shock    response   you must supply a. and b.

800.1 Want more information?
810.0
      Suppose you calculated the first five vibration frequencies
      and modes for n = 1 circumferential wave in your previous run,
      call it run no. 1.  Suppose you now want to calculate the
      response to random excitation.  In the present run, call it
      run no. 2, the state of the shell from random lateral or
      axial excitation [no rotational excitation (pitching)
      allowed!] is estimated by superposition of quantities
      calculated for each resonance:

       w(response) = SQRT{ sum from 1 to 5 of [m(i)*P(i)*phi(i)]**2 }

      in which m(i) is a frequency-dependent multiplier,
      P(i) is a modal participation factor, and phi(i) is the ith
      vibration mode, including modal stresses derived from
      appropriate differentiations of the modal displacements.
      For response to harmonic excitation, each mode is treated
      separately; the responses from the various modes are not
      superposed.

812.1 Want more information?
813.0  
      For all of the three types of analysis listed above an
      amplitude factor is derived which is a product of the
      modal participation factor, P(i), and the multiplier, m(i).
      The frequency-dependent multiplier, m(i), is given for each
      of the three analysis types by:

      For harmonic excitation (analysis type 1):

        m(i) = N(i)*g/[OMEGA**2*BETA(i)]

      For random excitation   (analysis type 2):

        m(i) = SQRT[OMEGA*SPECD/(2*BETA)]*g/OMEGA**2

      For shock response      (analysis type 3):

        m(i) = 2*N(i)*g/OMEGA**2

      [ N(i)=load factor, g = acceleration of gravity,
        OMEGA=freq.(rad/sec), BETA=damping, SPECD=spectral density]

815.1 Type of response analysis (1 or 2  or 3)
815.2  
      1 means response to sinusoidal excitation
      2 means response to random excitation
      3 means response to shock

820.1 Value of acceleration of gravity in the units of this case
830.0  
      Next, provide number of g's (N) vs. frequency (f) in hertz.
      If N varies with f, make sure that the data span the range of
      frequencies for which you calculated vibration modes in your
      previous INDIC = 2 run.

      NOTE: MAXIMUM OF 20  (N,f)  PAIRS IS ALLOWED.

840.1 Does N (no. of g's) vary with f (frequency)?
850.1 Number of g's, N
860.1 Frequency, f, corresponding to N
870.1 Want more entries in the N = N(f) table?
880.0  
      Next, provide damping factor (B) vs. frequency (f) in hertz.
      NOTE: MAXIMUM OF 20  (B,f)  PAIRS IS ALLOWED.

890.1 Does B (damping factor) vary with f (frequency)?
900.1 Damping factor, B
910.1 Frequency, f, corresponding to B
920.1 Want more entries in the B = B(f) table?
930.0  
      Next, provide spectral density (W) vs. frequency (f) in hertz.
      NOTE: MAXIMUM OF 20  (W,f)  PAIRS IS ALLOWED.

940.1 Does W (spectral density) vary with f (frequency)?
950.1 Spectral density (N**2/hertz), W
960.1 Frequency, f, corresponding to W
970.1 Want more entries in the W = W(f) table?
980.1 Do you want to find buckling load factors?
982.0  
      For horizontal (lateral) base motion, maximum compressive
      stress resultants are either at circumferential coordinate
      THETA = 0 degrees or THETA = 180 degrees. Print out meridional
      distributions of prebuckling membrane resultants along both the
      meridian at THETA = 0 deg. and at THETA = 180 deg; then decide
      which meridian to choose for the buckling analysis.  It may be
      a good idea to do buckling analyses corresponding to the stress
      states at both THETA = 0 and THETA = 180 deg.
